# STM32 Sensor mezzanine board, mbed™-enabled

The STM32 Sensor board is a 96Boards mezzanine board based around the STM32F446 MCU (named B-F446E-96B01A). This board enables users to prototype systems that are aware of their environment, thanks to the embedded sensors for movement, pressure and
sound. It can be plugged directly on top of 96Boards consumer edition (CE) products and supports multiple expansion possibilities through the Arduino™ Uno Revision 3 and Grove™connectivity. The integrated ST-Link debugger facilitates software
development, drag-and-drop programming and provides direct access to the ARM® mbed™on-line resources.

The 96Boards Mezzanine board with the STM32F446 MCU (B-F446E-96B01A) enables users to prototype systems that are aware of their environment, thanks to the embedded sensors for movement, pressure and sound. It can directly be plugged on top of the
96Boards CE cards and supports multiple expansion possibilities through the ArduinoTM Uno Revision 3 or the GroveTM connectivity. The integrated ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger facilitates software development, drag- and-drop programming and provides a direct
access to the ARM® mbedTM on-line resources.
