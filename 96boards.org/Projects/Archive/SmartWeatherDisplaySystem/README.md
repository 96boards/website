# Smart Weather Display System

This project is a smart home system design based on the DragonBoard™ 410c from Arrow Electronics. It utilizes the DragonBoard 410c network support function and
built-in Wi-Fi module for Internet connection. It is designed to use strong data processing power for the display of time, pictures, and sensor values.

The project was designed based on QT5.2.1. By utilizing the QT cross-platform characteristics, the developers compiled the APK running on an Android platform 
and then installed it to the DragonBoard 410c.

The aim of this project was to address the limitations that weather acquisition software typically is unable to satisfy individual users. The project is
designed to display real-time local weather, local time, acquiring indoor temperature and humidity and displaying personal picture gallery.
