# Maker

## Introduction

Hobbyists often want to quickly prototype their projects and show them to the community. For this
purpose the ability to setup the board quickly as possible is needed. With the help of the
Reference software platform, one can quickly start working with the 96Boards without much
difficulties. Maker community is a great way of foster collaboration among the like minded people.


## How can you get involved?

96Boards offer the maker community to get involved very quickly. With the help of the reference
software platform, one need not worry too much about setting the things up. Instead the time could
be spent on developing the application out of it. The availability of Mezzanine boards allows the
community to quickly interface sensors and actuators onto the system. Also, the 96Boards are
designed to have small footprint, which is ideal for making the board to fit in any constrained
case.
