# Machine Learning

## Introduction

The goal is to program computers to utilize example data, and statistical learning techniques to
identify patterns and create past experience to solve problems. In essence, a way to mimic, at a
basic level, the way humans rationalize their way to making a decision. As one might imagine, with
the amount of data flying around today, this would require an immense amount of computing power.


## How can you get involved?

96Boards often comes as a good candidate for Machine learning applications because of it’s rich set
of specifications. For anyone doing machine learning activities, a combined effort of CPU and GPU
is required. In that case 96Boards stands tall among the currently available SBC’s in market. It
could also be directly deployed to the end product with ease.
