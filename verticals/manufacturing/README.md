## Introduction

Manufacturing is a critical force in both advanced and developing economies. It is evident that
when technology advances so does our manufacturing techniques and environment. As our devices
become cheaper, smaller, faster, stronger, and increasingly more intricate, our developers must
find ways to stay ahead of the curve.


## How can you get involved?
