        The Bubblegum-96 board was first shown in mid 2015 at trade shows in Asia. Since then,
        Actions has been working with Linaro to finalize the software support and ensure the best possible performance.
        The board is based on the Actions s900 SoC and delivers high-quality graphics, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity,
        all packed into a board the size of a credit card. This board is expected to deliver top of the line performance and superior gaming.
        In addition to standard 96Boards features, the board will offer integrated HDMI with Ultra 4K output,
        Full HD video capture (1080P@60fps H.264) and ARM TrustZone® security support.

        The HiKey 960 development platform is based around the Huawei Kirin 960 octa-core ARM® big.LITTLE™
        processor with four ARM Cortex®-A73 and four Cortex-A53 cores with 3GB of LPDDR4 SDRAM memory, 32GB of UFS 2.0 flash
        storage, and the latest generation Mali™ G71 MP8 graphics processor. The board is provided by Archermind and LeMaker
        through multiple channels (see links on right).

        Initial software support for the board is provided in the AOSP source tree based on the Android Common Kernel using the Linux 4.4 kernel release.
        Linaro and Huawei are also working on the Linux 4.9 based Android Common kernel and maintaining support for the Kirin 960 SoC in the mainline kernel.org
        tree, allowing for the availability of multiple Linux distributions for this board in the future.

        The STM32 Sensor board is a 96Boards mezzanine board based around the STM32F446 MCU (named B-F446E-96B01A).
        This board enables users to prototype systems that are aware of their environment, thanks to the embedded sensors for movement,
        pressure and sound. It can be plugged directly on top of 96Boards consumer edition (ce) products and supports multiple expansion
        possibilities through the Arduino™ Uno Revision 3 and Grove™connectivity. The integrated ST-Link debugger facilitates software development,
        drag-and-drop programming and provides direct access to the ARM mbed on-line resources.

    product_long_desc: |-
        Available now from Seeed: This adapter is a USB to UART interface to be used with any base board compatible with the 96Boards Consumer Edition or Enterprise Edition specifications.

        It makes it easy to connect your PC to the serial console on the 96Boards low-speed expansion connector, without worrying about pinout or level shifting for 1.8V IO. It also provides remote control of the power button and reset signals so that the base board can be completely controlled over a single USB cable.

        Since it uses the FT230X chip from FTDI, when it is connected to your PC over USB, it appears as a normal UART interface on a PC, Macintosh or Linux computer with an FTDI UART driver installed.

    product_long_desc: |-
        The 96Boards Sensors Mezzanine adapter makes it simple and easy to connect sensors and devices to any 96Boards-compatible base board. With it you can connect your favourite Grove modules and Arduino compatible shields and interface to software running on the 96Boards baseboard. It provides everything you need to start experimenting and prototyping on the 96Boards platform.

        On the board you will find sockets for 18 Grove modules, an Arduino-compatible shield socket, and two SPI headers. It also includes an ATMega328 microcontroller which can be programmed from the Arduino IDE and will run most Arduino UNO sketches unchanged. The shield connector and half of the Grove sockets are controlled by the microcontroller, while the remaining Grove sockets are controlled directly by the baseboard. This makes it a flexible prototyping platform which supports both direct control of devices from application software, and offload to a microcontroller. It also provides a USB-UART interface to access the base board’s serial console.

        This is a 12V 2A power supply with universal connectivity on both ends.
        A little more expensive than a standard 1.7mm or 2.1mm supply with a
        fixed power plug , we have used these on the HiKey and DragonBoard 410c
        boards without any issues or adapters required. One thing to ensure is
        that the board end is connected with center pin positive.
