**Jeff Johnson and the new four port ETH Mezzanine (Opsero)**

Get ready to hear all about the new 96B 4-port ETH Mezzanine by Opsero! In this episode of OpenHours, we will be joined by the creator himself to hear all about this awesome new Mezzanine for the Ultra96. During the course of our stream, we will examine the technical specs of the board, explore a variety of use-cases and possibly get to see a demo.

**If you would like to learn more about Opsero and the new mezzanine before the show, feel free to poke around the resources below:**

Bring you questions & coffee and/or beer (water or juice :-P) and tune in at our regular time of 4:00p UTC on Thursday! See you there.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on Zoom and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
