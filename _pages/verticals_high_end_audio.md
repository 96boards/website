# High End Audio

## Introduction

Getting the high end audio devices seemed to be very expensive but with the advent of 96Boards, one can easily construct those devices with ease. High end audio usually refers to the high quality in recording as well as playback. The ‘audiophiles’ are  more interested in getting quality in recording the sound rather than playing back. The recording of the sound depends on various factors such as Microphone, Audio filter, In-built amplifier and so on.


## How can you get involved?

96Boards allows the developer to create the high end audio devices with the help of the dedicated
DSP processing unit. In CE edition, Dragonboard has the integrated DSP which could be used for
creating such devices. Apart from the DSP processing unit, almost all 96Boards has the high
resolution PCM’s which allows the efficient capturing of analog signals.
