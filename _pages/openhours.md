### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on Zoom and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
