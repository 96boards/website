# Community

Your chance to get involved! 96Boards will soon be launching OpenHours bounties and leader board. A community "To-Do" list is in the works which will allow anyone to pick up tasks to earn 96Boards community points. Compete with other community members for status, and/or use your points to get your hands on 96Boards / OpenHours swag and giveaway items!

Coming soon...
