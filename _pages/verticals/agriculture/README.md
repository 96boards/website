# Agriculture

## Introduction

Today’s young generation is reinventing agriculture using IoT. In order to increase the productivity and efficiency, it is mandatory to have various technologies in place. One of the key challenges when it comes to agriculture is the lack of manpower. The ideal way to tackle this issue is to automate the processes, 96Boards are designed having these end goals in mind.

## How can you get involved?

96Boards are an ideal candidate for bringing technology into agriculture. It offers both processing power as well as controlling ability, these are mandatory for automation. With the ability to interface additional components such as cameras, actuators, and other miscellaneous sensors, one can choose a 96Boards for prototyping and set a strong path toward production. Also, the long term SoC support renders additional benefits as the developer need not to be worried about being obsolete.
