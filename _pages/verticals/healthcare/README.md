# Healthcare

## Introduction

Many who plan to develop for the healthcare industry know that reliability and long term support
are key. The 96Boards model is designed to provide developers with choices throughout the entire
development process. Cross-compatibility between 96Boards within the same family (CE, IE, EE) and
long term SoC support from select vendors should make any developer feel protected against
obsoletion. Prototyping around the 96Boards footprint and designing around our vendorâ€™s SoCs
provides a sure fire way to go through every phase of development without worry.


## How can you get involved?

96Boards offers developers the opportunity to choose. Anyone is now capable of taking on this
diverse sector, with diverse needs. Simply pair up with one of our many boards, choose a worthy
development environment, and plug away. 96Boards offers a healthy pool of SoC options, which allows
developers a straightforward path to production. Building custom devices for your 96Boards chip has
never been this streamlined.
