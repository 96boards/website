# Robotics

## Introduction

The availability of easy to use, open source computer vision software, bleeding edge graphics,
powerful processors, low footprint hardware, and so much more, has kicked DIY robotics to new
heights. The diverse nature of robotics requires a diverse hardware and software approach, this is
what 96Boards aims to offer.


## How can you get involved?

From bite-sized, single task robots to multi-functional, automated systems, 96Boards can be used to
bring even the most imaginative mechanical device to life. Choose a 96Boards platform based on your
desired development environment (Operating system) and available features to get started.
