**OpenHours Episode #82** - Let's step into the past, the OpenHours past. Back when questions and conversation ran wild, heated forum discussions and bottomless coffee mugs! This week, we bring back the meaning of "Open" in OpenHours as we draw on the community for content! The 96Boards team will hand pick hot forum topics to discuss, we hope those who join have thoughts to share as well. See you soon! 

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
