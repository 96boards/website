### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxyNWlsZzFibDVwZzNrZjJ0b2s5aWtjdm9fMjAxNzEwMTlUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com)

**OpenHours Episode #75** - OneRF designed a robust IoT gateway based on 96Boards DragonBoard 410c for outdoor and industrial IoT.
With DragonBoard 410c, the gateway has edge processing capacity. This means processing happens closer to the source, via the gateway, instead of traveling to the cloud. 

The gateway collects raw data from sensors and devices, processes it locally and communicates only information to cloud. DragonBoard 410c board will enable the use of Qualcomm's NPE (Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine). NPE allows the running of trained neural networks without a need for connection to the cloud. Complex data analysis and process decision could be made in the gateway.

The radio modules can be embedded in diverse applications. Since the contest, we have more solutions that we would like to show on OpenHours: An Intelligent Photocell for Public Lighting Control, a Smart Meter application, Monitoring Module for Industry, a Waste and Water Level Monitoring module and a Parking Sensor device.

Join us this week on our OpenHours live broadcast to meet the OneRF team and get all of your questions answered in this interactive and fun setting! See you at the end of the countdown.

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc..
