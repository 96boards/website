**Fall in love with the Oxalis!**

**This week** during OpenHours, we will be breaking new records by bringing on an entire line up of industry professionals to talk about one of the newest Arrow Electronics 96Boards, the Oxalis! This new 96Boards addition is an Enterprise board which made its debut earlier this year, and now will have a chance to shine. Grab a hand full of candy hearts and keep your eyes peeled, because you never know when Cupid will strike! Join us for this years Valentines Day OpenHours special event, and fall in love with the Oxalis <3

Near ubiquitous broadband internet connections and a multitude of distributed embedded systems, in the IoT world introduces new challenges in data transfer performance and communication security.

The Oxalis meets these challenges head on and provides a high performance IoT gateway solution with low power consumption in a modular architecture.

We will discuss this board at a high level, exploring the many technologies that went into making it possible. Then, we will meet with engineers from companies that made it, and discuss a wide variety of potential use-cases. Before the end of the show, we will also see a live demo of the Oxalis in action. We hope you are as excited as we are, so make sure to tune in!

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!
