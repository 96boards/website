**OpenHours**

**This week**, we will be meeting with Kate aka [githugs](https://www.instagram.com/githugs/) from Instagram! Kate majored in art and bartended in the service industry for many years. During this time, she started teaching herself to code. Eventually she attended a bootcamp (Hack Reactor) and graduated from there in January 2018 (earlier this year)! Shortly after graduating, she got her first engineering job in New York, working and specializing in javascript, react and node. Bring your questions and coffee (or beer) and join us for an hour of fun conversation with the one and only [githugs](https://www.instagram.com/githugs/)!

The show is also broadcasted live on the 96Boards [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/96Boards/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/96Boards/live) channels.

We also take questions through our [OpenHours IRC channels](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

[OpenHours spent the entire month of May talking all about Women in STEM!](https://www.96boards.org/go/wistem-2018/) Each week, we had interviews from women in fields spanning multiple disciplines. From computer science and engineering, to chemestry, materials and more... Each featured guest joined us to tell their story filled with challenges and triumphs while also taking questions from our OpenHours hosts and the community.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
