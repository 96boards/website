**OpenHours**

Phase two, OpenHours is about to unfold, and we welcome everyone to join in for the fun. The current plan was outlined last week in our [phase two pilot episode](https://youtu.be/QPijdGYpLoA), but will most likely be touched on once again this week as we tackle new goals for the broadcast and attempt to bring new and exciting content forward in the form of technical interviews and showcases. We are currently working to book out the rest of the years interview slots, so if anyone is interested in joining OpenHours as a featured guest, please reach out to Robert Wolff (robert.wolff@linaro.org) to reserve a slot.

**This week**, we will be meeting with two groups of students from the University of California, San Diego! Each group spent the last 10 weeks working with 96Boards to create a couple of very cool projects. **One of the projects is a self-sustainable mobile workstation (powered by solar), and the other project is based around crypto!** In the one hour of eloted time, each group will have about 20 minutes to talk about their project and of course take questions from the 96Boards team and community. We look forward to see you there!

The show is also broadcasted live on the 96Boards [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/96Boards/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/96boards) channels.

We also take questions through our [OpenHours IRC channels](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

[OpenHours spent the entire month of May talking all about Women in STEM!](https://www.96boards.org/go/wistem-2018/) Each week, we had interviews from women in fields spanning multiple disciplines. From computer science and engineering, to chemestry, materials and more... Each featured guest joined us to tell their story filled with challenges and triumphs while also taking questions from our OpenHours hosts and the community.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
