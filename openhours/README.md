**OpenHours**

Phase two, OpenHours has started - [Check out the pilot here!](https://youtu.be/QPijdGYpLoA)

**This week**, we will meet with [Susanna L. Harris](https://www.instagram.com/susannalharris/). Susanna is a PhD candidate at UNC-Chapel Hill studying “plant probiotics”, she studies how beneficial bacteria stick to plant roots and whether this community of microbes helps or hurts the plants’ growth. She hopes this research may help develop safe microbes to replace harsh chemicals for increasing crop production.

In March 2018, Susanna founded [The PhDepression LLC](https://www.instagram.com/ph_d_epression/) to open discussion of mental illness in Higher Education through curation of stories and resources. She speaks openly about her own depression and mental illness, including in a [widely-viewed speech](https://vimeo.com/286214085).

We will speak with Susanna about the ups and downs of grad school, her scientific research, and her founding efforts (and the people) behind PhDepression LLC. The broadcast / livestream is open to the public, we welcome healthy discussions and questions around any of the topics brought forth by our featured guest and 96Boards support.

For more info prior to the stream, check out [The PhDepression LLC website](https://www.thephdepression.com/) or @ph_d_epression on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ph_D_epression) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ph_d_epression/). Susanna can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SusannaLHarris) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/susannalharris/) at @susannalharris

The show is also broadcasted live on the 96Boards [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/96Boards/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/96Boards/live) channels.

We also take questions through our [OpenHours IRC channels](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

[OpenHours spent the entire month of May talking all about Women in STEM!](https://www.96boards.org/go/wistem-2018/) Each week, we had interviews from women in fields spanning multiple disciplines. From computer science and engineering, to chemestry, materials and more... Each featured guest joined us to tell their story filled with challenges and triumphs while also taking questions from our OpenHours hosts and the community.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
