### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxyNWlsZzFibDVwZzNrZjJ0b2s5aWtjdm9fMjAxNzA4MDNUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com)

**OpenHours Episode #64** - This week on OpenHours we will meet with HIJ! Along with a recap of last week's amazing episode with the Brazilian partnership program, we will also be talking with HIJ about their voice assistant for 96Boards. This project/product not only builds in the adaptation for AI adapter, voice acquisition, noise reduction processing, ASR and NLP semantic understanding platform, but also docks with live and video on demand apps. It can be woke up and interrupted by “Hello, Xiaole” which truly achieves the idea “Hands Free Eyes Free”. HIJ voice assistant can achieve voice interaction dialogue within 10 meters, but also can listen to music, search movies and watch TV live for free. The folks at HIJ will be giving us access to their code, resources and more! See you there.

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
