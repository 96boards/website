**OpenHours Episode #86** - Multiple security vulnerabilities were unveiled this last week, and it affects just about everyone under the sun. Considering our deep involvement with many of those affected, we thought it would be suitable to bring one of the experts onto OpenHours. In this episode we will learn about these vulnerabilities (**Meltdown** and **Spectre**), how they may affect our everyday lifes, what the experts are doing to fix this, and how we might go about getting these updates as quickly as possible to minimize any damage. Please join me, this week in welcoming **Joakim Beck** - The Technical Lead for the Linaro Security Team. If you have any questions about this security breach and what you can do to stay protected, join us on **Thursdsy at 4:00pm UTC**! See you there.


Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
