**OpenHours**

Phase two, OpenHours has started - [Check out the pilot here!](https://youtu.be/QPijdGYpLoA)

**This week**, we will be speaking with Janelle Letzen, the sushi scientist! Janelle is a PhD and postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University conducting research on brain function associated with chronic pain. She is a self-taught food artist who started Sushi Science at the beginning of this year in the hopes of making complex neuroscience topics more approachable for students and informal learners.

You might be wondering, what is sushi science? Well, you will have to take a look for your self! Before joining us, make sure to pay a visit to Janelle's website and/or instagram to witness some of the amazing creations she has made (and the amazing science she explains!). And, to answer a question people most frequently ask: yes, she eats and/or shares all of her creations! Sample her work at [thesushiscientist.com](https://www.thesushiscientist.com/) or on Instagram ([@the_sushi_scientist](https://www.instagram.com/the_sushi_scientist/)).

As an added bonus to this week's episode, Robert and Janelle will be creating a tech sushi showcases (tech stuff made of sushi!) to present and eat during the broadcast! If you have any sushi science to share for yourself, we invite you to bring your creations and join in on the fun. Robert will also be drinking sake :-P so for those who really want to get in the sprit, you will not be alone!

Janelle's welcomes questions from the community and is glad to address some of the following topics:

- Brain function in chronic pain; chronic pain treatment; mood, motivation, and chronic pain
- What the scientific process is like and things people might want to consider in reading popular science articles
- Her doctoral clinical training (cognitive-behavioral therapy; acceptance and commitment therapy; mindfulness-based stress reduction; mental health)
- Why she started Sushi Science and how she makes her creations
- Her sushi preferences and select techniques (... Not sushi master chef, but we are sure she will out create Robert :P)
- Her life outside of science/sushi

So set your reminders and add us to your calendar! This week, OpenHours goes to sushi to explain science (and some tech).

The show is also broadcasted live on the 96Boards [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/96Boards/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/96Boards/live) channels.

We also take questions through our [OpenHours IRC channels](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

[OpenHours spent the entire month of May talking all about Women in STEM!](https://www.96boards.org/go/wistem-2018/) Each week, we had interviews from women in fields spanning multiple disciplines. From computer science and engineering, to chemestry, materials and more... Each featured guest joined us to tell their story filled with challenges and triumphs while also taking questions from our OpenHours hosts and the community.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
