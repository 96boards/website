**It's that time of year again! Tomorrow, we go "Live from Linaro Connect" in Bangkok, Thailand**

This Connect happens to be very special in that there are so many table sponsors showcasing a lot of great new 96Boards! That being said, we have decided to do something different... For those of you who have followed our Linaro Connect Livestreams, we usually do a sort of panel. Not this time! Tomorrow, during our stream, we will BOOTH HOP! All of our sponsors have been notified of the stream, and they will be there to "show us what they got".

To give you all an idea of what we will see, we will be speaking with the following sponsors:

[Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/), [Rockchips](www.rock-chips.com), [Arm](https://www.arm.com/), [Qualcomm](https://developer.qualcomm.com/), [Arrow](https://www.arrow.com/), [Shiratech](http://www.shiratech-solutions.com/), [Packet](https://www.packet.com/), [Avnet](https://www.avnet.com) and [Xilinx](https://www.xilinx.com/)! Each sponsored table will have 5-7 minutes to tell us about the very cool things on their table, which includes new product showcases and demos.

Hopefully the odd broadcast time doesn't throw you all off too much, we hope as many of our regulars will still be able to tune in. If not, the video will be there waiting on YouTube! Don't forget to check back at some point to watch the recording and tell us what you think.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on Zoom and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
