### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxyNWlsZzFibDVwZzNrZjJ0b2s5aWtjdm9fMjAxNzA5MTRUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com)

**OpenHours Episode #70** - Does anyone remember the [home surveillance project](https://github.com/96boards-projects/home_surveillance) created by Mani Sadhasivam (96Boards Applications engineer) several months ago? Well since then, people from Qualcomm have taken this project and turned it into a nice little DIY kit! What better place to showcase this kit and a great demo than on OpenHours... And who better to explain these efforts than Rajan Mistry, Qualcomm's seasoned OpenHours representative of the show (don't quote me on that one). Either way, Rajan joins us all the time on OpenHours, and this time he will be there as our featured guest. We will talk about the project it self, the reason behind it's consumption, and the eventual contributions that were made by Rajan and his team back into the project. Join us this week to see and hear more about this great effort, check out the demo, and get your questions answered. All are welcome! See you there.

Now is your chance to be a part of the discussion. Bring your questions and comments on past, present and future plans around the Snapdragon work with Linaro, the DragonBoard 410c, and pretty much anything else 96Boards related. All are welcome!

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
