### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cThpZGZ1Nzg1Nmk1Zm1mMWFjY3RoaGkzbGtfMjAxNzEyMjFUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)

**OpenHours Episode #83** - The holiday season is here and so is the time of giving (says many traditions :-)! For this, we once again welcome back [maddog](https://twitter.com/maddoghall) to share with us his holiday cheer and gift ideas during this wonderful time of the year. In this second annual holiday special, we will take open source gift giving to a whole new level as we look into some ideas that require a bit of work, some that require a bit of $$$, and other that are just plain fun or worthwhile to the open source enthusiast. So, dress in your finest holiday robes and join us in celebrating open source as a reason for the season!

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
