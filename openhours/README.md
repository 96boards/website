### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxyNWlsZzFibDVwZzNrZjJ0b2s5aWtjdm9fMjAxNzEwMDVUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com)

**OpenHours Episode #73** - Saúde Certa(Safe2Med) is a project that aims to minimize the error in the administration of medicines and at the same time allow a smarter interaction of patients in hospital beds, allowing information transparency and real-time monitoring. This time on OpenHours, you will get to meet the creators of this amazong prototype/product. Together we will discuss their development path and future product plans. If you have a product idea with 96Boards and would like to find out more about how people are using these platforms to bring their products to life, this is your chance. Join us in welcoming the folks from Safe2Med, bring your questions, comments, and favorite mug of coffee or tea! In the wake of Linaro Connect (SFO17) we will have much to discuss.

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
