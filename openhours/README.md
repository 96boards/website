### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxyNWlsZzFibDVwZzNrZjJ0b2s5aWtjdm9fMjAxNzA4MTdUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com)

**OpenHours Episode #66** - Come, tell the world about Monero and Kovri! Share your Linaro / 96boards experience! In this episode we will discuss the work accomplished by the Kovri / Monero team and community as well as what collaborations are in store for the future.

Monero is a community-driven cryptocurrency designed to deliver always-on fungibility, privacy, and anonymity. Monero’s Kovri I2P Router Project provides users with the ability to run and access nodes that hide their geographic location and IP address. When used in conjunction with Kovri, the origin of Monero transactions is concealed to protect the privacy of the sender while mitigating network monitoring and other attacks. Cross-platform support is made possible by automating builds and testing on Linaro/96boards systems.
/u/fluffyponyza, /u/hyc_symas and /u/anonimal_0x914409F1 are confirmed for the call. All are welcome!

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
