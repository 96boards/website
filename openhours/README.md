**OpenHours Episode #63** -  Next time in OpenHours, we will be joined (in person/on site) by all the winners from the [Brazilian Partnership Program](http://www.96boards.org/go/db410c-partnership-brazil/) and their entourage! In person and live, you can join in on the fun as we take over the Qualcomm Thinkabit lab on Qualcomm campus San Diego, California! Our seasoned OpenHours engineer (Rajan), former featured participant and event oraganizer (Bruno Evangelista), Embarcados CMO (Thiago Lima), and the group of winners will join us to share their experience in organizing, running, and participating in this amazing new way to hack on the 96Boards platform and contribute to the greater community in a positive way. Keep an eye on the countdown, we will be there when the clocks hits zeros!

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
