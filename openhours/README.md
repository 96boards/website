### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cThpZGZ1Nzg1Nmk1Zm1mMWFjY3RoaGkzbGtfMjAxODAxMDRUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)

**OpenHours Episode #85** - Tune in for this week's OpenHours! Sahaj, from the 96Boards team, will be demoing a Superfast NAS(Network Attached Storage) with the 96Boards Poplar TV Enterprise board! Since Poplar has a USB3.0 and a Gigabit LAN Interface, It is the best candidate for a Superfast NAS. This project will go through the process of setting up hardware and software NAS using SMB(Samba) so it can be accessed across multiple OS. Since we will be using the gigabit ethernet interface, it will suffice to stream high bitrate content over multiple clients and to transfer large files over seconds. Demos and talks of the Poplar, this on Thursday at 4:00p UTC! See you there.


Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you
