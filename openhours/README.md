**OpenHours Episode #89** - This week on OpenHours we will finally be talking about the Coursera launch many have been waiting for. Joined by representatives from UCSD, Qualcomm and Linaro/96Boards, we will give an in depth look at the new specialization curriculum, talk about our support plans, and take as many questions as possible! For those who are interested in scoping out the specialization, you can find more information [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things). We look forward to seeing everyone during the live BlueJeans broadcast; however, you can also find us on our other channels.

The show is also broadcasted live on the 96Boards [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/96Boards/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/96boards) channels.

We also take questions through our [OpenHours IRC channels](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
