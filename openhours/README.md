### This week – [ADD TO CALENDAR](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxyNWlsZzFibDVwZzNrZjJ0b2s5aWtjdm9fMjAxNzExMDJUMTYwMDAwWiBhMXFxdjZqaHIxYTBhdDJzbGxuazVpNzRpNEBn&tmsrc=a1qqv6jhr1a0at2sllnk5i74i4%40group.calendar.google.com)

**OpenHours Episode #77** - This week on OpenHours, we will be joined by students from the [UCSD IoT Specialization on Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things). We will talk about the renovations of both Course 2 and 3 as well as the future efforts that will be made for the entire specialization. We will discuss the new capstone (multiple options for submission) as well as their plans for ramping up their continued support in future iterations. We will also take some time to get in touch with our roots, half of this episode will be dedicated to fun discussions and any Linaro / open source / 96Boards questions you may have for our guests, community regulars and host.

Join us this week on our OpenHours live broadcast to meet the OneRF team and get all of your questions answered in this interactive and fun setting! See you at the end of the countdown.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you

The 96Boards Team
