**Talking FPGAs on OpenHours with Adam Taylor**

Adam Taylor is a Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology. And better known for the very popular MicroZed Chronicles based on using the Xilinx Zynq SoC.

Throughout his career he has implemented a wide variety of solutions from RADAR to Safety Critical Control Systems, with interesting stops in Image Processing and Cryptography along the way.

Over the years he written for a number of publications and presented at a number of conferences including EE Times, Programmable Planet, Xilinx Xcell Journal and Xilinx Xcell Daily Blog. His website, [ADIUVO Engineering](http://adiuvoengineering.com/) collates them all into a single archive.

So bring all your FPGA related queries and join us for an exciting episode of OpenHours with Adam Taylor.

We also take questions through our [OpenHours IRC channels](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

[OpenHours spent the entire month of May talking all about Women in STEM!](https://www.96boards.org/go/wistem-2018/) Each week, we had interviews from women in fields spanning multiple disciplines. From computer science and engineering, to chemestry, materials and more... Each featured guest joined us to tell their story filled with challenges and triumphs while also taking questions from our OpenHours hosts and the community.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
