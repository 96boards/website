**OpenHours**

Phase two, OpenHours has started - [Check out the pilot here!](https://youtu.be/QPijdGYpLoA)

**This week** (for our surprise episode), we will be meeting with [Brandy Morgan](https://www.instagram.com/msbrandymorgan/) of [Creators Code](https://creatorscode.co/)! Brandy is a developer, designer, and doer who could out hustle Jay-z. Her work has received recognition and acclaim from Awwwards. Brandy has been featured in Glamour and Money magazine for her work on social media for paving the way for other female developers. If she isn't coding or working on Creators Code, you can find her running laps around the beautiful lakes of Winter Park, FL or sipping espresso at the local coffee shops. At Creators Code their mission is to cohesively integrate the technologist and the creative, for building successful and authentic connections online. From corporate marketing teams to individuals focused on personal branding, Creators Code provides the tools to develop creative and innovative data-driven strategies to optimize your online presence. This is your chance to come hang out with Brandy for an entire hour! Bring your coffee and/or tea (and/or beer ;-)) and join us on BlueJeans, YouTube, or Facebook for the livestream. The 96Boards team have a bunch of questions, but we encourage anyone who is joining to speak up and contribute to the converstaion. See you on Thursday!

The show is also broadcasted live on the 96Boards [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/96Boards/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/96Boards/live) channels.

We also take questions through our [OpenHours IRC channels](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

[OpenHours spent the entire month of May talking all about Women in STEM!](https://www.96boards.org/go/wistem-2018/) Each week, we had interviews from women in fields spanning multiple disciplines. From computer science and engineering, to chemestry, materials and more... Each featured guest joined us to tell their story filled with challenges and triumphs while also taking questions from our OpenHours hosts and the community.

### What is 96Boards OpenHours?

**96Boards OpenHours – Sponsored by Linaro** welcomes you every week at 4:00pm UTC to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. Bring your coffee and questions, demos and feedback, together we can make a difference for everyone!

We’ll begin these sessions with introductions and announcements, presentation or tutorial and then be open to answer any questions regarding 96Boards products, the specifications, troubleshooting etc.. We don’t promise to answer all the questions immediately and may need to defer answers to a later session, but we’ll try our best to answer during the call.

These sessions will be held on BlueJeans and recorded so they can be made available after the session. There is a limit to a 100 participants so it will be first come first served initially!

We look forward to talking with you.

The 96Boards Team
