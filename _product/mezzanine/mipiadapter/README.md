      There are bidirectional voltage-level translators which allows for low-voltage bidirectional
      translation between any of the 1.2-V,1.5-V, 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V voltage nodes.
      So it is compatible with 3.3V or 5V modules and makes connecting peripherals easy.
      You just plug a jumper onto JP9 to select which input voltage you need.
