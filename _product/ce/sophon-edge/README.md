    The Bitmain Sophon™ Edge Developer Board is designed for bringing powerful Deep Learning capability to various types of applications through its quick prototype development. Sophon Edge Developer Board is powered by a BM1880, equipping tailored TPU support DNN/CNN/RNN/LSTM operations and models. This board is compatible with Linaro 96boards while also supporting modules for Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Developers can leverage off-the-shelf modules and develop cutting edge DL/ML applications, like facial detection and recognition, facial expression analysis, object detection and recognition, vehicle license plate recognition, voiceprint recognition, and more!

**NOTE:** Many compliance items for this board were waived due to the nature of the chipset being used and the uniqueness of the board. The Edge BM1880 TPU ASIC accels in its AI and deep learning abilities, for this reason, the following items were waived in order to accomodate the Sophon Edge into the 96Boards ecosystem:

- Instead of OTG or C port near center of board, the two host ports are pushed into the center, and it uses a 3.0 A port as OTG.
- Does not have any display output capability.
- Does not have high speed connector.
- Ethernet port exeeds component maximum height limit of 6.5mm.
