    The Bitmain SophonTM Edge Developer Board(EDB) is designed for bringing powerful Deep Learning capability to various type of applications through its quick prototype development. Sophon Edge Developer Board is powered by BM1880, which equips tailored TPU supporting DNN/CNN/RNN/LSTM operations and models. The edge developer board is compatible with Linaro 96boards while supporting modules for Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Developers can leverage off-the-shelf modules and develop cutting edge DL/ML applications, like facial detection and recognition, facial expression analysis, object detection and recognition, vehicle license plate recognition, voiceprint recognition, etc.
