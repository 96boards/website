# HiKey960

The HiKey 960 development platform is based around the Huawei Kirin 960 octa-core ARM® big.LITTLE™ processor with four ARM Cortex®-A73 and four Cortex-A53
cores with 3GB of LPDDR4 SDRAM memory, 32GB of UFS 2.0 flash storage, and the latest generation Mali™ G71 MP8 graphics processor. The board is provided by
Archermind and LeMaker through multiple channels (see links on right).

Initial software support for the board is provided in the AOSP source tree based on the Android Common Kernel using the Linux 4.4 kernel release. Linaro and
Huawei are also working on the Linux 4.9 based Android Common kernel and maintaining support for the Kirin 960 SoC in the mainline kernel.org tree, allowing
for the availability of multiple Linux distributions for this board in the future.
