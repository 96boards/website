    The Robotics DragonBoard™ 845c development board is based on the Qualcomm® SDA845 processor.
description: |-
    The Robotics DragonBoard™ 845c development board is based on the Qualcomm® SDA845 processor. The Qualcomm SDA845 processor is a heterogeneous computing architecture and integrates an Octa Core Qualcomm® Kryo™ CPU with performance up to 2.8GHz  a Qualcomm® Adreno™ 630 Visual Processing Subsystem (including GPU, VPU and DPU), and a Qualcomm® Hexagon™ 685 DSP with Hexagon Vector Extensions (HVX) delivering sophisticated, on-device AI processing and mobile-optimized computer vision (CV) capabilities for perception, navigation and manipulation. The development board supports Linux and Robotics Operating System (ROS), while also including support for the Qualcomm® Neural Processing software development kit (SDK) for advanced on-device AI, the Qualcomm® Computer Vision Suite, the Qualcomm® Hexagon DSP SDK, and AWS RoboMaker. The development board supports new architecture for AI, 4K@60fps H.264/H.265 Encode & Decode, rich interfaces, and many I/O expansion headers. It is an ideal platform for developers to quickly start the product development work. Note: DragonBoard 845c is ONLY available in the Qualcomm® Robotics RB3 Development Kit.
