    Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 Development Kit is based on the Qualcomm® QRB5165 Robotics SoC.
description: |-
    The Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 Development kit contains a robotics-focused development board and compliant with the 96Boards open hardware specification which supports a broad range of mezzanine-board expansions for rapid prototyping.<br> At the heart of the kit is the Qualcomm® QRB5165 processor, customized for robotics applications, which offers powerful heterogenous computing architecture that delivers 15 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) of compute. The processor also offers incredible machine learning (ML) accuracy, a powerful image signal processor (ISP) with support for seven concurrent cameras, a dedicated computer vision engine for enhanced video analytics (EVA), as well as the new Qualcomm® Hexagon™ Tensor Accelerator (HTA). Its fifth-generation Qualcomm® AI Engine powers inferencing and accuracy with the dedicated Hexagon Tensor Accelerator. QRB5165 can support an industrial temperature range of –30C to +105C, with long life support. The kit can also offer LTE/5G/CBRS communications via a mezzanine card.<br>The QRB5165 processor and Qualcomm Robotics RB5 platform cater to wide range of applications such as autonomous mobile robots (AMR), inventory robots, retail robots, cobots, pick-sort-place robots, cleaning robots, first mile robots, last mile delivery robots and delivery drones, prosumer and commercial drones, industrial & manufacturing robots, healthcare robots, defense robots, etc.<br>For robotics designers who need heterogeneous computing and LTE/5G with low power consumption, the Qualcomm Robotics RB5 development kit offers a base for proofs of concept and rapid prototyping. The kit is made to streamline development and shorten time to commercialization.<br>There are two options to purchase the Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 Development Kit. The Core Kit includes just the mainboard and the QRB5165 SoM, whereas the Vision Kit includes the Vision Mezzanine and Camera Modules.<br>Note: Intel® RealSense™ Depth Camera D435i is not included. It can be purchased separately.

The Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 Development kit contains a robotics-focused development board and compliant with the 96Boards open hardware specification which supports a broad range of mezzanine-board expansions for rapid prototyping. 

At the heart of the kit is the Qualcomm® QRB5165 processor, customized for robotics applications, which offers powerful heterogenous computing architecture that delivers 15 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) of compute. The processor also offers incredible machine learning (ML) accuracy, a powerful image signal processor (ISP) with support for seven concurrent cameras, a dedicated computer vision engine for enhanced video analytics (EVA), as well as the new Qualcomm® Hexagon™ Tensor Accelerator (HTA). Its fifth-generation Qualcomm® AI Engine powers inferencing and accuracy with the dedicated Hexagon Tensor Accelerator. QRB5165 can support an industrial temperature range of –30C to +105C, with long life support. The kit can also offer LTE/5G/CBRS communications via a mezzanine card.

The QRB5165 processor and Qualcomm Robotics RB5 platform cater to wide range of applications such as autonomous mobile robots (AMR), inventory robots, retail robots, cobots, pick-sort-place robots, cleaning robots, first mile robots, last mile delivery robots and delivery drones, prosumer and commercial drones, industrial & manufacturing robots, healthcare robots, defense robots, etc.

For robotics designers who need heterogeneous computing and LTE/5G with low power consumption, the Qualcomm Robotics RB5 development kit offers a base for proofs of concept and rapid prototyping. The kit is made to streamline development and shorten time to commercialization.

There are two options to purchase the Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 Development Kit. The Core Kit includes just the mainboard and the QRB5165 SoM, whereas the Vision Kit includes the Vision Mezzanine and Camera Modules.

Note: Intel® RealSense™ Depth Camera D435i is not included. It can be purchased separately.
