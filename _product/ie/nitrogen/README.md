    The BLE Nitrogen is joint efforts by 96Boards and Seeed, aims to provide economic and compact  BLE solutions for IoT projects.

    Nitrogen is a 96Boards compliant IoT Edition board which aims to provide economic and compact BLE solutions for a variety of IoT projects. This board features the nRF52832 microcontroller by Nordic, 64kb of RAM and 512kb of onboard flash storage. An easily accessible 40 pin low-speed expansion connector and onboard antenna offer a wide variety of IO on the much desired 96Boards IoT form factor.
