# Advanced Hardware Security for IoT at Scale

The Shield96 board based on Microchip silicon is available in two different forms.

The **Shield96 Standard** reference platform provides a secure solution applicable across all IoT verticals. This trusted Linux turn-key solution addresses hardware security by design. This hardware allows users the ability to design a solution as needed to fit their custom needs.

The **Shield96 Trusted Platform** comes preloaded with the EmSPARK Security Suite software by Sequitur Labs. This provides a secure platform applicable across all IoT verticals to enable secure end point solutions and protect firmware, keys and data throughout the lifecycle of a product. EmSPARK is the essential software companion suite complementing the Microchip hardware providing a cost-effective secure solution appropriate for every connected device built with the ATSAMA5D2 processor. Engineers can leverage this reference design for digital transformation built on trust extracting the full value of the advanced embedded security features of the ATSAMA5D2.
