This section is for all USB devices that work on 96Boards. This will hopefully include USB Adapters, USB audio solutions, USB cameras and moreâ€¦ Note that we do not plan to list out USB hubs or USB mice and keyboards, but if there are particularly innovative solutions that we feel are worth listing, they may be listed here or in miscellaneous.
