    accessory_title: Universal power supply
    accessory_description: |-
        This is a 12V 2A power supply with universal connectivity on both ends.
        A little more expensive than a standard 1.7mm or 2.1mm supply with a
        fixed power plug , we have used these on the HiKey and DragonBoard 410c
        boards without any issues or adapters required. One thing to ensure is
        that the board end is connected with center pin positive.
