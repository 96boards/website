    accessory_title: Universal power supply
    accessory_description: |-
        This is a 12V 2A power supply with universal connectivity on both ends.
        A little more expensive than a standard 1.7mm or 2.1mm supply with a
        fixed power plug , we have used these on the HiKey and DragonBoard 410c
        boards without any issues or adapters required. One thing to ensure is
        that the board end is connected with center pin positive.

*** 

The 96Boards CE boards require an 8-18V 2A power supply.

We recommend a 12V 2A adapter with a DC plug that has a 4.75 mm outer diameter with 1.7mm center pin (EIAJ-3 Compliant).

Easiest way to prepare AC adapter for 96Boards is to have both bellow.

1. AC adapter which has 12V 2A DC output with DC plug has 5,5 diameter and 2.1 mm center pin. (Center pin positive)
2. DC plug converter from 5,5 diameter with 2.1 mm center pin to 4.75mm diameter with 1.7mm center pin.
