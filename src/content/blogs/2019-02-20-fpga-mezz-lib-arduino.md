# The FPGA Mezzanine Library

Check out one of my older blogs on this library: [WIP FPGA Mezzanine GPIO Library](https://www.96boards.org/blog/fpga-mezz-lib/)

The Arduino header bits of the library are now complete!

You can find the library at:
    - [https://github.com/96boards-projects/fpga_mezz_lib](https://github.com/96boards-projects/fpga_mezz_lib)

And the documentation can be found at:
    - [Interfacing with Arduino IO](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/mezzanine/shiratech-fpga/guides/fpga-mezzanine-library.md.html)

We also have a few examples to get the library working with a few shields
    - [Interfacing with L298n Motor Controler](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/mezzanine/shiratech-fpga/guides/l298n.md.html)
