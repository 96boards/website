# Introduction

This week, we spoke with Ron Justin from [GroupGets](https://groupgets.com/) and Michael Welling of [QWERTY Embedded](http://www.qwertyembedded.com/). Thanks to these two, we were able to launch the first ever crowd funded 96Boards Mezzanine! Michael, who is the lead maintainer of the [96Boards Mezzanine Community](https://github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community), created a GPS/Proto/Debug Mezzanine and open sourced it in the above mentioned repository. With major help from Ron at GroupGets, we were able to get this board posted… Now comes to task of getting it funded! In this livestream, we glossed over the crowd funding event; however, we were more interested in talking about these two great companies!

Qusestion for Mr.Torvalds: I heard that most of the people (like me) step away from the hardware designing due to the high lead time involved. How are you dealing with it?
Thanks!

Todd Thal - TT
Seperate "devcon" from "defcon"...

Michael: Since you have worked with both RISCV and ARM architectures, which one would be a best bet for a open hardware designer (apart from open architecture nature of RISCV)

Nathan used to speak at meetups (a bit like this openhours...)...Met him when he just started and barely had a roof over his head...now a multimillionaire!...(maybe a future vision for Robert!)...;    )

Todd Thal - TT
What are the comparative lengths of both instruction sets?
Eg
ARM
RISCV

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
@Todd: Maybe! lol :P
@Todd: probly not tho

Todd Thal - TT
Which architecture "pipeline" instructions at faster throughput?
Eg computer time = instructions/program * clock cycles/instructions * seconds (nano or pico seconds) /clock cycles

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
@Todd, we will address your questions in a sec :D

Todd Thal - TT
This is an old architecture issue...been going on for decades...wish my "guru" maddog was here!!!....;    )
