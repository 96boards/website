# Introduction

In this episode we talk about Fuchsia OS, Fedora Flock, the new protomezzanine from the mezzanine-community repository and more! Join us as we meet with Sahaj Sarup from [Geek Till it Hertz](https://www.youtube.com/user/sahajsarup) to discuss his efforts around the Magenta Kernel and Fuscia OS for [96Boards](https://96boards.org/). The community chimes in on 96Boards issues and forums posts and finally we take a look at the 96Boards Mezzanine initiative and the newly tested "proto-mezzanine" (links, video and chat log below).

Andy!
To what do we owe the pleasure?

Andy from Workshopshed - AW
I was interested in the protoshield
Too slow
Work commitments
Maybe Tindie?
or a group buy thing
Cool

Todd Thal - TT
What is the "protoshield"?... links? wiki? GitHub about this?

Barry - B
The design in on GitHub so you can get your own printed locally

look at tax/customs categories, eg gift is low to zero tax.
i would put my first line of address as "Gift from my Gran" to reduce customs

Ilo Rivero - IR

Tyeth - T
Has anyone found E-paper with driver over a couple of inches?
the pong looked good

Todd Thal - TT
I have a comment about "platform/frameworks/languages" "religion" issue that I see coming up, similar to problem like early ( and maybe even today) w linux (.. ask maddog history N lessons learned to do differently now)... when Robert asks I can mention the specifics I just observed...

Ilo Rivero - IR
Cool

Andy from Workshopshed - AW
Too close

Tyeth - T
you following the nodejs foundation stuff todd? i used to thnk it was a great example of dealing with commercial and technical and public stakeholders / framework religion until i heard from rodd vagg about madness today.
What's your latest beef?

Robert Wolff - RW
@Carl: are you the same Carl that added me on Linkedin the other day?

Carl - C
yup that's me

Robert Wolff - RW
Great!
Just wanted to make sure before I assumed when answering your message
thanks for connecting !

Carl - C
thank you
they all accept docker corret?

Tyeth - T
no to openstack only research. similarly there are starting to bring platform agnostic abstraction libraries for cloud provided services. still lambda is a bit new for that yet

Dieter - D
Sorry guys, I had to leave! Was a pleasure to listen

Robert Wolff - RW
Thanks, Dieter!

Carl - C
FWIW ina a study or errors per lines of code on open sorce software postgresql was the best by far.
mssql was realy a port of sybase

Tyeth - T
and all so context specific

Andy from Workshopshed - AW
Catch you all later. Will check out the proto mezz on the recording. Cheerio

Tyeth - T
bye Andy

Robert Wolff - RW
Thanks, Andy!
Have a nice day

Carl - C
Are the futire topics listed somewheere?

maddog - M
I quickly read it, and this paper was not so much "for SQL" as it was "MapReduce it not good".  The mentions of SQL was more as an example of a high level language to access the data, not necessarily SQL itself.

Carl - C
OK - perfect1
it sounds like a reference linux core to me

Robert Wolff - RW
@Carl: could be
