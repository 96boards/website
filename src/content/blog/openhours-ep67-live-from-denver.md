# Introduction

This episode was hosted from the Hyatt Regency hotel lobby in Denver Colorado. The episode caught me slightly off guard since I had just finished attending a conference and was on the way to the airport (headed home). Luckily, there was just enough time to take the call and and enjoy some good last minute conversation before heading off to the airport!

The episode didn't focus on anything in particular. We hung out and talked about a couple projects as well as the future episodes that are to come.

A suggestion I have would be exposing the SPI I/O pins (SDI,SDO,SCK) and a couple of other I/Os (for chip selection and Interruptions) in a
basic header or edge connector. And, of course, some I/O level translation to +3.3V.

jean-marc - J
the audio mezzanine fill almost this request

CEZAR - C
Good!
Mile height city?
nice mountains over there.
Thanks. Good bye, all!
