# Introduction

The big 90! This week we come at you with possibly four segments (time permitting) that will surely make you anticipate the weeks and months to come.

- A look at the Cello EE board!
- 96Boards documentation and website revamp overview
- What’s next? A look at all new and upcoming 96Boards, releases and speculation.
- Q&A throughout the entire show! So bring your questions…

If you want to register the remaining sessions or watch the recording of the past sessions, you can take a look at their website.

The consumer edition has no heat sink or fan? It most probably runs off a very slow CPU. An ARM chip?

Sahaj - S
depends on how the soc is designed
the cello also had an arm chip by amd

@Khushal Ill try to address your Q soon

Khushal Khan - KK
Does the 22 NM technology have better heat dissipation properties? It has lower power requirements, but still high frequencies would generate heat because the heat generated/volume wouldn't improve a lot

ydh7620 - Y
Is there a special reason why the Cello board is so big in size compared to the Consumer Edition Boards ?

Robert Wolff (Screencast) - R(
It is intended for different purposes

Khushal Khan - KK
Your generating lower heat, but then you're running smaller chips, so heat/unit volume wouldn't improve much or does it? It would only if it is narrower, so has better dissipation properties.
It isn't excruciatingly slow, is it?
Do these run multiple threads in parallel? Or would these be too elemental for that?

Ragnar. - R
a bit tiny text there

Robert Wolff (Screencast) - R(
We will get to the rest of the questions shortly.

Ragnar. - R
thank you

ydh7620 - Y
Thanks Carl for answering my question.

Boot button: You need to hack it with a 555 ancient timer chip that wired for a single pulse that will pull the boot button low or high for a few msec as needed.
... when it gets powered. That would requre a power cycle though.

Interested in testing docker containers in many ARM platforms running various versions of linux
similar to browserstack

freenode is the network !

Carl Perry - CP
Ivan: I have similar interests. I'm also interested in trying to get Railcar working on various ARM boards now that Docker is closed source and very hard to build

Guest 19 - G1
docker closed source ? wtf
