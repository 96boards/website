# Ripe Fruit Identification

Ripe fruit identification using an Ultra96 board and OpenCV.

## Project Details

- **Creator:** Md. Khairul Alam
- **Project Name:** Ripe Fruit Identification
- **Type of Project:** Demonstrations (Projects showcasing individual features of a 96Boards product)
- **Project Category:** Computer Vision, Object Detection
- **Board(s) used:** [Ultra96](/product/ultra96/)

## Introduction

Autonomous robotic harvesting is a rising trend in agricultural applications, like the automated harvesting of fruit and vegetables. Farmers continuously look for solutions to upgrade their production, at reduced running costs and with less personnel. This is where harvesting robots come into play.

During recent years a lot of research on this topic has been performed, either using basic computer vision techniques, like colour based segmentation, or by resorting to other sensors, like LWIR, hyperspectral or 3D. Recent advances in computer vision present a broad range of advanced object detection techniques that could improve the quality of fruit detection from RGB images drastically.

Single Board Computer like Raspberry Pi and Untra96 added an extra wheel on the improvement of AI robotics having real time image processing functionality. In this project I will show how ripe fruits can be identified using Ultra96 Board. Pre-installed OpenCV image processing library is used for the project. The concept can be implemented in robotics for ripe fruits harvesting.
