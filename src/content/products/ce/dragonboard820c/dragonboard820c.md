The DragonBoard 820c development board is based on the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 820E embedded
platform with the custom 64-bit Qualcomm® Kryo™ quad-core CPU and is compliant with the 96Boards
Consumer Edition Extended Version specification managed by Linaro. The combination of the
Snapdragon 820E embedded platform’s powerful Qualcomm® Adreno™ 530 GPU and quad-core CPU
expands the possibilities of connected computing and high quality visual experiences while providing the
ultimate in power efficiency. The DragonBoard 820c development board supports a wide range of
interfaces and is ideal for prototyping complex embedded computing applications, from realistic visual
and audio immersion for VR and AR applications, to machine vision and artificial intelligence for
commercial drones and robots. The Snapdragon 820E embedded platform is designed to provide a fast-
track deployment path, with integration services and production-ready, customizable SoMs (System-on-
Modules) and SBCs (Single Board Computers) available to turn a DragonBoard 820c based invention into
a commercial product.
