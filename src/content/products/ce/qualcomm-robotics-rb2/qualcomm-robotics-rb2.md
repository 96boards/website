  Qualcomm® Robotics RB2 Development Kit is based on the Qualcomm® QRB4210
  Robotics SoC.
description: The Qualcomm® Robotics RB2 Development kit contains a
  robotics-focused development board and compliant with the 96Boards open
  hardware specification which supports a broad range of mezzanine-board
  expansions for rapid prototyping.<br> At the heart of the kit is the Qualcomm®
  QRB4210 processor, customized for robotics applications. The QRB4210 SoC
  offers maximum mid-tier benefits delivering greater performance. With the
  Qualcomm® Kryo™ 260 CPU architecture for increased speeds and robust on-device
  performance, in addition to the 3rd generation Qualcomm® AI Engine, this
  platform delivers powerful performance, dynamic camera capabilities and Wi-Fi
  6-ready connectivity, ideal for industrial and commercial IoT applications
  such as industrial handhelds in logistics and warehousing, security panels and
  cameras. For increased intuitive on-device intelligence, devices based on this
  new solution will help enable productive and efficient work environments.<br>
  Built on the Qualcomm Robotics RB1 and Qualcomm Robotics RB2 platforms, the
  kits are ideal for OEMs, ODMs, and IoT developers. In a cost-effective
  package, they combine the computing, camera features, artificial intelligence
  and connectivity you need to take mass-market robotics and IoT products to
  consumers.<br> There are three options to purchase the Qualcomm® Robotics RB2
  Development Kit. The Core Kit includes just the mainboard and the QRB4210 SoM,
  whereas the Vision Kit includes the Vision Mezzanine and Camera Modules, and
  the Full Kit includes a display panel in addition.<br>
