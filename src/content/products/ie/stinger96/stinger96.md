# Advanced Hardware Security for IoT at Scale

**STINGER96** is a 96Boards IoT Edition compatible (IE extended) base board from Shiratech. The board provides full support for 96Boards IoT Edition (IE) mezzanines via the Low Speed expansion connector, and features LTE connectivity using the Quectel BG96 NB-IoT modem.
The board incorporates the following key elements:
- **STM32MP157** SoC with dual Arm ® Cortex ® -A7 and Cortex®-M4 Cores, a very energy-efficient, performance rich SoC, highly suitable for low-power embedded and consumer applications.
- **Quectel BG96 LTE** an ultra-low power consumption LTE Cat-M1/NB1/EGPRS module delivering 375Kbps downlink and 375Kbps uplink data rates. Also provides pin-to-pin compatibility with Quectel LTE module EG91/EG95, Cat NB1 (NB-IoT) module BC95, UMTS/HSPA module UG95/UG96 and GSM/GPRS module M95.
- **Running Yocto** – A Linux distribution aimed for embedded and IoT software.
- 96Boards Low Speed expansion connector, allowing the connection of additional 96Boards mezzanines as needed.
- 2 micro USB connectors (USB and monitor), a micro SD card connector and a micro SIM connector.
