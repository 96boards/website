# Seeing Eye Robot

The Seeing Eye Robot is a Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ Micro Rover from Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. powered by a DragonBoard™ 410c that is designed to identify a person and stay in front to help them navigate.

### Objective

Inspired by the idea of creating a robotic seeing eye dog, the goal was to create a Snapdragon Micro Rover that follows a person by always staying in front of that person. This rover could then use proximity detectors to warn someone about obstacles in the path, and could be particularly useful for the visually impaired.
