# Emulating BLE Heart Rate Sensor

This project shows how to read values from a Bluetooth Low Energy device CSR1010 using DragonBoard™ 410c from Arrow Electronics. In this example, the CSR1010
is emulating a heart rate sensor.

The main objective of this project is to utilize Bluetooth Low Energy devices and understand how different Generic Attribute Profiles (GATT) are implemented to
support a variety of applications. This project uses the Heart Rate Profile which is a type of sports and fitness profile that is used to emulate a heart rate
sensor.
