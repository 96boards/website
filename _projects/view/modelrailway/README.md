description: |-
    This project shows you how to configure the DragonBoard 410c to allow it to control a model railway using DCC (Digital Command and Control) and open source JMRI software, via a USB/DCC interface. In this particular case, the focus is on controlling the track and signaling, but the codebase also includes the ability to program DCC locomotives.
