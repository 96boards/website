# NFC Smart Access Control System

Many large office buildings allow entry by door access control systems using RFID modules. An NFC module is typically more expensive than simply an RFID module, but also usually features more powerful functions and security features. This project is designed to simulate a door access control system based on an NFC module. An NFC module is loaded on the DragonBoard™ 410c from Arrow Electronics using libnfc open-source code to provide access control, and a two-color LED light is used to indicate if an NFC card passes through the access control system.

Years ago, I loaded an RFID module onto a system via a serial port. However, the operating system was Win CE. With the rise of NFC, I had an idea to study the NFC module and make use of the opportunity to learn HDMI, LED and other module controls. Main learning content:

- Learning the NFC module. Presently, the NFC concept is very popular and its future application prospects such as secure payment will be extensive
- Learning to use a program to control LED light switch-on/off
- Learning the libnfc open-source framework
- Research on developing the mainboard-carried HDMI module
