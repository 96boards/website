description: |-
    This project is designed to use the DragonBoard™ 410c from Arrow Electronics with a HS-100 ultrasonic module to detect the distance a person is from a fan to help prevent injury. The system is designed to transmit the distance value detected to the DragonBoard 410c and switch off the fan by triggering a relay connected to the DragonBoard 410c. The system is also designed to turn on the fan when the proximity near the fan is clear.

# Ultrasonic Fan Control

This project is designed to use the DragonBoard™ 410c from Arrow Electronics with a HS-100 ultrasonic module to detect the distance a person is from a fan to
help prevent injury. The system is designed to transmit the distance value detected to the DragonBoard 410c and switch off the fan by triggering a relay
connected to the DragonBoard 410c. The system is also designed to turn on the fan when the proximity near the fan is clear.

Traditional fans with rotating blades can be hazardous to little children. News about children’s fingers being injured by fan blades is too frequent. This
project uses the available resources to try to reduce such accidents.
