# Spark v1 - 6x SFP+ mezzanine

This mezzanine board enables Ultra96 to be used as 1U universal networking device router/switch/tester with 6x SFP+ interfaces

Objective
Enable Ultra96 as platform for networking applications

The spark board includes:

- 6x SFP+ ports with electronics and 2x leds each
- 1x Translated 96boards secondary extension slot
- 3.3V power supply for the SFP+ modules
- Low speed SFP+ extension interface 6x 10 pin header for optional handling in extension board of the 3.3V low-speed signals

- Use Case 1 – Ultra96 with 6x Linux interfaces (eth0-eth5) with full datapath FPGA programmability
- Use Case 2 – Ultra96 6x interface OpenFlow switch
- Use Case 3 – Ultra96 network interconnect tester with YANG model and NETCONF interface according to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vassilev-bmwg-network-interconnect-tester/
