## Introduction

I have a young son who has just turned one, and this summer the UK has been rather unusually hot.

This makes for a great summer however at night when my son is trying to sleep a warm room makes it difficult for him to sleep well. Warm rooms can also be dangerous with respects to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
