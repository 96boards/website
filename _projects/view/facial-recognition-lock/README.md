# AI Facial Recognition WiFi Lock


Using facial recognition to unlock a deadbolt through Netduino WiFi.

## Project Details

- **Creator:** Peter Ma
- **Project Name:** AI Facial Recognition WiFi Lock
- **Type of Project:** Demonstrations (Projects showcasing individual features of a 96Boards product)
- **Project Category:** Computer Vision, Facial Recognition
- **Board(s) used:** [Ultra96](/product/ultra96/)


## Introduction

iPhone X Face ID hits people with surprise, people starting to realize through AI deep learning their face is much more unique and accurate than their fingerprint.

We've built a platform that shows how the AI on the Edge works on Ultra96 and Intel Movidius NCS and Tensorflow Inception Facenet, using all the default camera that came with the development kit. This project can be extended to using facial recognition to unlock deadbolts, record entries, turn on different light themes, and many others.

For the first part of the guide, we used Android to open the lock via WiFi. If you have already completed the Netduino WiFi Lock, you can skip straight to Step 5. In which we will be using AI on the Edge to unlock the deadbolts.
