# Android TV - DragonBoard 410c

This project attempts to build Android TV on the DragonBoard™ 410c from Arrow Electronics. The main objective was to utilize the Android TV Input Framework, and this was done by running the built-in reference LiveTv App and Sample Input Apps.

The Android TV Input Framework implementation includes the TV Input Manager, which allows the communication between the TV App and the Inputs. The TV Input Framework allows different kind of inputs including External STB, Built-in Tuner Input, HDMI Input etc.

To start, we used the Reference LiveTv App built for ARM64 as a TV App and the Sample Input apk for the TV Input. The Sample Input allows the user to configure the Channels in two different ways:

- Simple Input, which consists of local video files that act as different channels.
- Rich TV Input consists of 4 Channels served from Google Cloud Storage, which are comprised of MP4 Videos, HLS Stream, MPEG - DASH Stream.

We have also implemented the Custom Launcher to provide the look and feel of the TV Launcher and integrated the IR Sensor onto DragonBoard 410c for controlling TV Activities with Universal Remote.

### Dependencies:

An Exo player is built and installed in order to play the videos.

### Further Work in Progress:

Fine tuning the performance and built-in tuner implementation.
