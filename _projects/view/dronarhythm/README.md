# DronaRhythm

DronaRhythm is an audio control system designed to allow drones to be virtually always-on, and respond to their environment in real-time without needing specific user input.

### Objective

There were a variety of inspirations for this project, but it boiled down to combining robotics, audio (or music), and drones. From there the project evolved to creating a drone that could respond to audio, which would be a fun application of drone technology that could open up new drone use-cases in the future.

The desired result is to have drones that can perform certain actions in response to audio cues from their environment. In the future, there will be many drones flying around performing various tasks. If they also have the power of hearing, they could respond much better to their environment in order to perform better, or perform additional tasks. An example of this could be a drone performing a simple function such as delivering a package, but then it could also help in other ways. While the drone is delivering a package, if it can hear glass breaking or people screaming nearby, it could go over to where the sounds are coming from and start recording the situation in order to alert the police.
