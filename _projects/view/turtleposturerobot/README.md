# Fit Turtle Posture Robot

Fit Turtle is designed to use the Kinect to extract a skeleton model of your body and analyze the alignment of your spine and head. It will follow you using the camera on the TurtleBot, powered by a DragonBoard™ 410c, and provide audio feedback about your posture.

### Objective

The primary goal for this project is to increases awareness about how to maintain a healthy posture: tighten your glutes, tighten your core, and pull your shoulders and head back.

This project also demonstrates how a fairly simple algorithm can be easily integrated into a roaming bot and effectively analyze posture.
