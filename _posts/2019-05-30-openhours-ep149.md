# Introduction

In this episode, we covered quite a few things. Even though it is labeled as an AMA, we do not get very many questions during the stream, and we usually just cover things that are going on in the 96Boards and tech space. Sahaj went over his new RB3 Robot Arm project, and walked through his blog. Then, we talked about some new projects, especially the new [Click Mezzanine from Avnet](https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/us/products/new-product-introductions/npi/96boards-click-mezzanine/). By the end of the show, we went through some forums posts and took several tangents. Enjoy!
