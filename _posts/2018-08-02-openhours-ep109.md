# Introduction

**This week**, we met with **Ramon Horkany** from [Shiratech Solutions](http://www.shiratech-solutions.com/). Shiratech is a new 96Boards partner who has hit the ground running with two amazing 96Boards mezzanine boards, which will soon be available to the public! Want to know more about these products? You will need to join the call! Throughout the hour long broadcast, we will talk about Shiratech's new tech, ask and answer questions from the community and hopefully showcase one of these new mezzanine with a fun demo! Don't miss this one, but if you do... You can always watch the recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-NF6S9MM_W1QBjUc2B5Pg502bz7qslxk), but that will never be as much fun... Get your coffee, see you soon.

Please take some time to watch the video below, and don't forget to tune in for the next [OpenHours - Follow the countdown here](https://www.96boards.org/openhours/)

$$ ?

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
Let's ask 

MishraDK - M
Can we use the RPI connector and Arduino shield together ? hope any shield does not cover the RPI connectors ..
Or use a flex cable..
And if the RPI connectors are exposed .. hope they dont short anything on shield on top..

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
MishraDK, true, this happened with other mezzanine in the past without proper standoffs

MishraDK - M

Tyeth Gundry - TG

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
