# Introduction

**This week**, we had three special contest announcements! In the first half of the broadcast, we spoke about several contests which will take place in many places around the world, and how YOU can get involved. We were joined by representatives from each one of these contests who outline the rules and submission deadlines as well as the giveaways and prizes that come along with your participation! The second half of the hour was dedicated to general 96Boards discussion and community Q&A.  We event enjoyed a demo from one of our community leaders, [Timothy Thomas](https://www.instagram.com/timothy_issac_thomas/) who shared a very cool Arduino demo he had been working on.

Please take some time to watch the video below, and don't forget to tune in for the next [OpenHours - Follow the countdown here](https://www.96boards.org/openhours/)

Hi rajeev -- top 30 submissions by Aug 27 get a free Ultra96 Development board. The top 3 projects win prizes, including a Google Pixelbook. We also are awarding a trip to Silicon Valley to attend the 2018 Xilinx Developer Forum happening Oct 1-2, 2018. This winner will get to showcase their project at XDF.
Thanks, Tim, for that link! I don't see a way to submit yet, though. Let me ask when that submission will open.

Bruno Evangelista - BE
Rajeev, Timothy, yes, I'm surprised it's written there... but I already accepted the submissions from other countries... I will remove it
yes, 18 older because brazilian laws

Tim D. Hammer - TH
1/2 hour after OpenHours "ends" is what the timers indicate. Looks like Brazil is first, then ARM Robots, then Avnet/Xilinx.

Timothy Thomas - T
Rob I have a question

Bryan Fletcher - BF
Project submissions will be judged based on their creativity, application of Artificial Intelligence, and use of programmable logic. Thoroughness of a project submission will also be taken into consideration.
Submissions Should Include
•	Detailed description of your project. What is it, what does it do, how does it work?
•	Quality images and/or videos
•	Story with clear instructions
•	BOM (Bill of Materials)
•	Source code and schematics

rajeev - R

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
Go ahead
@Tim

Pan - P
Hi Robert. I sent you as PM earlier (as "Guest 7" I think)

rajeev - R
there r 2 types of  pi cam is...1) with IR 2) without IR

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
Pan, whats up
sorry, I didnt get it

Mani - M
Sorry its me

Timothy Thomas - TT
Is ARM Cortex-A73 MPCore4 @up to2.36GHz or ARM Cortex-A53 MPCore4 @up to1.8GHz, a selection on HiKey 970?? or does it follow big.LITTLE format??

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
http://www.lenovator.com/product/102.html

Sahaj - S
@tim It Does follow

Pan - P
@Robert:I'm good thanks! It was about the Pyra project - whether you managed to get in touch with Michael

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
Yes! I got his email. I am sorry, I will be in contact with him soon
I will at least ping the thread to appologize for the delay

Timothy Thomas - TT
And if it goes that way Hikey 960 would be preferably better right?

Sahaj - S
http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn65dsi84.pdf

Timothy Thomas - TT
Because it has 4 Cortex A73 + 4 Cortex A53 Big.Little CPU architecture

Pan - P
@Robert:OK awesome. Let me know if I can be of any help!

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
Thanks, Pan! I appreciate that. I look forward to talking with Michael about Pyra, it is exiting, just have been super busy

Timothy Thomas - TT
Actually, I just saw a video of DragonBoard 810c, that supports a arm laptop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ItXpmLsINs
And this video is shot in Linaro Connect, Demo day

Pan - P
