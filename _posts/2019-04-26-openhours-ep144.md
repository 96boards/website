# Introduction

Secure Firmware with David Brown of Linaro!

David Brown is a Senior Engineer at Linaro who has been working on ARM Linux since about 2007, as well as general Linux and other kernels for many years before that. He also enjoys learning and working with new programming languages.

With decades of experience, David is the perfect person to tackle the complex and technical topic that is “Secure Firmware”. In this week’s episode of OpenHours, we will get a general overview of trusted firmware, discuss the differences between Cortex A and M, and review both setups!

A setup: boot, TF-A, OP-TEE and Linux
M setup: mcuboot, TF-M, and work in progress
