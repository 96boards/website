# Introduction

This week, we met with [Andrew from Distrupt it Yourself](https://www.instagram.com/disruptityourself/), who uses 3D printers and other disruptive tools to encourage others to make! Andrew was seriously well versed and fun to listen to! Throughout the entire episode, no matter the question, Andrew had an answer, "disrupting" even my ability to stump him with my toughest 3D printing queries. Take the hour to check out the interview below, and I am sure you will learn something new! If you would like to follow Andrew's future projects and initiatives, don't be afraid to click his links in the resources section to give him a follow!

Ragnar, did you ever end up getting package from Fathi?

Ragnar - R
not yet... I actually pinged him earlier _today_, as I just lost my irc backlog due to a server reboot

Todd Thal - TT
Good morning "96 boards" said with a "Good morning Vietnam"-cadence ...; )

Timothy Thomas - TT
Yep

Todd Thal - TT
Has "disruptive" technology become so "disruptive", that it is "disrupting itself?...; )
Is audio working?

Disrupt It Yourself - DY
The prophecy said it would...
Everyone is muted

Ragnar - R
no video...
ok

Todd Thal - TT
The "everyone is muted" comment reminds me of a monty python movie, where they are mute and deaf when the boss is around, but are ok when the boss leaves...; )

Da Xue - DX
Great interview!

Robert Wolff
Thanks Da!
You have questions for Andrew?

Haitao Zhang - HZ
Hi, Andrew, this is Haitao from uCRobotics, couple of questions, 1. Any Open Source SLA/SLS pritner like Formlabs? 2. How do you like fully open sourced 3D printer like Ultimaker/BCN with Duel extruders? 3.  Any comments about very low price, not open sourced yet but sounds popular 3D Printers like Creatilty CR-10?

Da Xue - DX
No, pretty much agree on all the points he mentioned. He really knows his ....

Robert Wolff
@Haitao, I will ask him your questions in a second

Da Xue - DX
Haitao, are you in the Google usergroup for LCD printing?
lots of valuable resources there

Haitao Zhang - HZ
4. How big do you think the gap between Open Sourced slicing software like Cura and proprietary slicers like Simplify3D?

Todd Thal - TT
What does Andrew think of
https://www.alephobjects.com

Haitao Zhang - HZ
@DaXue, ah, not yet, but are LCD/DLP silimar to SLA/SLS?

Todd Thal - TT
Their printer is
https://www.lulzbot.com

Da Xue - DX
yes
simplify3d is vastly superior to cura
in terms of fine printing
Andrew, have you played with Deltas and Trynamic ICs?

Todd Thal - TT
Andrew jeff moe is very approachable
(Jeff is a self-taught genius!)
https://www.linkedin.com/in/jebbamoe/
https://www.alephobjects.com/Investor_Relations.html
Many questions, hopefully he can get to all of them  I will bring them up after this answer

Todd Thal - TT
Aleph objects lulzbot is (near) 100 % open source software and hardware!!
(Also used to have the largest "print box " size..)

Question about "usage" markets:
1). 2 HUGE markets that have become TOTALLY closed and proprietary is-
A). Agricultural products (Eg tractors; combines; implements)
B). Automotive
Does Andrew know of projects helping to make A n B accessible

Da Xue - DX
I can send you a machine if you want one Andrew.
