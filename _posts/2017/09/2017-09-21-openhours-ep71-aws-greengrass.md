# Introduction

Edge computing and industrial IoT were on the docket for this week's OpenHours. Once again, we were joined by Rajan Mistry from Qualcomm to talk about the amazing efforts put forth to enable the 96Boards DragonBoard 410c with [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/). Everyone wants to know more about this subject, this was our chance to get the tough questions answered from one of the best! Rajan took questions from me and the community on the DragonBoard 410c, Qualcomm in general, Snapdragon, AWS, Greengrass, Industrial IoT and more! Don't forget to check out the resources, links, chat lot and video below.

I see this services as an analogy of what Command and Control Systems have been doing for a long time in SCADA controlled industrial
networks.
Are those edge devices seen as gatway borders for network conversion and/or data preprocessing?

Robert Wolff - RW
@Rafael: yes

Rafael Campos - RC
thanks
are those AWS services "dockerized" into the Dragonboard?

Hi Robert, is there anything similar what Ubuntu Core snap system offers for OS administration, updates etc. from Linaro?
I am testing Ubuntu Core on dragonboard mainly for safety reason.

Robert Wolff - RW
Have you heard of Testing Days?
@Atilla

We are implementing Snapdragon module to an edge gateway design with IO analog/digital and communications options.
Thanks.

I have to leave, will come back to you with more details. I am in contact with the Ubuntu guys, however the hardware level is very
dependent on Qualcom on the Snapdaragon platform. I am talking about hardware access to SPI, UART etc.
