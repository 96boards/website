# **Introduction**

Day one of the Open Source Summit in North America started out with a bang! After the scheduled morning meditation and breakfast, a series of Keynotes kicked off which truely set the pace for the rest of this very active convention. Jim Zemlin started us off with the [opening remarks](http://sched.co/BCyk), Christine Corbett Moran took over and addressed the [social and political impact of Open Source](http://sched.co/BCyl), Alan Clark brought us a [lightning talk on Human Enablement](http://sched.co/C2hd), finally a [fire side chat with Linus Torvalds](http://sched.co/BCzD), and the ultimate closer with the one and only Jono Bacon on ["The Impact of the Ecosystem"](http://sched.co/BCzH).

After the keynotes, crowds made their way to the sponsored showroom where industry leaders showcased their latest tech and offered plenty of swag!
