# Introduction

This week (August 17th) on OpenHours we met with several folks from Monero and Kovri (cryptocurrency and I2P service). In this episode, we got a crash course on cryptocurrency, talked about Monero as a type of cryptocurrency, and of course touched on Kovri as a secure, private, untraceable C++ implementation of the I2P anonymous network. Our featured guests walked us through the ins and outs of these two very exciting topics and explained the linchpins of the Monero and Kovri model.

Please take some time to watch the video below, and don't forget to scroll through the chat log below for any additional resources and questions brought forward by our guests and the community. 

If you have more questions, you can always join the following channels on IRC to meet with myself or this episode's guests (fluffypony, hyc and/or anonimal): #96Boards, #OpenHours, #monero, #monero-dev, #kovri and #kovri-dev

We look forward to seeing you in our next episode!

you should flip your video horizontally so it shows up the right way for us ;)
@Riccardo: BlueJeans is supposed to do that for you. Don't know why it isn't for his camera

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
ah ok

palexander - P
Oh, its backwards?  Let me fix that
There you go!
niceeee

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
lol nice

palexander - P
So how about Blockstream's satellite broadcast?  That kind of caught me off guard.  Jeff Garzik may be a bit jealous.

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
yeah it's very cool
brb

Sahaj Sarup - SS
hey all

unknownids - U
pigeons was having audio issues

bigreddmachine - B
So this is cool.

Guest 36 - G3
o/

hyc - PC - HP
ironic I've got the chat window open on my laptop, using my phone for audio/video. the PC is heating up. phone doesn't care.

Guest 36 - G3
odd, not sure why my username isnt showing
hyc to be fair, cellphone CPUs are designed to sip power
id say they use significantly less per cycle than a laptop CPU

hyc - PC - HP
eh true

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
also your phone is probably offloading a lot of encoding to the SOC encoding chip / GPU
and laptop may not

bigreddmachine - B
aww I was hoping anonimal would garble his voice. maybe he's actually british and has been practicing his american accent?

Guest 36 - G3
Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni
I like the namechange

hyc - PC - HP
nodes all around the world - or all around the solar system...

Guest 36 - G3
a friend is in contact with the guy who did the bitcoin satellite thing. Supposedly he's cool making a Monero one too, I think the launch cost is like 100k
though that might be better allocated to research/dev

Charley - C
^ wow

Guest 36 - G3
I can find out more if people want (this is needmoney90)

ViolentlyPeaceful - V
100k in dev would be more useful than 100k on a satellite for the moment i guess

unknownids - U
needmoney thats got FFS written all over it

Guest 36 - G3
yeah I know

binaryFate - B
hi everyone

Guest 36 - G3
putting it up in the first place would be knowing it would suck funds from other projects

bigreddmachine - B
needmoney90 - Chris Cook? I'm working on getting him on my show! Adam Back is helping put me in touch.

Guest 36 - G3
in all likelihood
yes bigreddmachine 
I can get you a contact/chat
if the adam channel is slow

bigreddmachine - B
Thanks, we'll see what happens. I sent an email to Blockstream's PR person and CC'd Back as he instructed me. It was his idea for me to talk to Chris so I think it shouldn't get pushed aside.

Guest 36 - G3
ah cool
well, if he gets on your show, ask him about a Monero setup. You can get a straight answer on price

bigreddmachine - B
pigeons looks a lot like Riccardo... twins?
yeah for sure!

unknownids - U
yeah theyre sisters

Bruce - B
I run 3 nodes

Guest 36 - G3
I only run one 

hyc - PC - HP
I've got ... a dozen or so at any given time

Guest 36 - G3
one pipe?

hyc - PC - HP
two different ISPs

Guest 36 - G3
I would presume the limiting factor is the pipe
no?

Tyeth - T
what board are you building on?

Shovan Sargunam - SS
Some of our 96Boards can be found here https://www.96boards.org/products/

Sahaj Sarup - SS
@robert nice monitor upgrade

hyc - PC - HP
I've got a Hikey960

madLyfe - M
im getting this: http://i.imgur.com/qqjurYM.png

hyc - PC - HP
nice kit

unknownids - U
mebbe i should buy one

Tyeth - T
fair is the beast of the group

JuiTengHsu - J
i'm using jetson tx2 and nutsboard

hyc - PC - HP
original PR https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng/pull/700
was merged a few months back

Raj - R
will it take time to discuss on cryptocurrency? if yes I will come back after some time

Tyeth - T
nice guys at mininodes

hyc - PC - HP
btw, bragging points - I wrote the optimized monero mining code for ARMv7 and ARMv8

bigreddmachine - B
^^ and he plays a mean fiddle.

hyc - PC - HP
lol

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
official Monero GUI and CLI clients are on https://getmonero.org
web wallet (SMALL AMOUNTS ONLY): https://mymonero.com

Raj - R
no questions 

Tyeth - T
how do u feel forks of the mainline should be handled, at what point should benefitting the masses outweigh what was agreed as the right way to do things, eg bitcoin/ethereum issues/forks?

Sahaj Sarup - SS
Every cryptocurrency has a sort of an "expiration date" after which point it can't be mined, just exchanged. Can that be increased indefinitely?

Smith - S
I have question

hyc - PC - HP
Sahaj - Monero has a perpetual tail emission, so yes.

Justin (sgp) - J(
Monero has a tail inflation such that the new coin supply will never fall below 0.3 XMR/minute
*tail emission

unknownids - U
more info on tail emission: https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/23/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-tail-emission

Sahaj Sarup - SS
oh ohkay, thanks 

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
Tyeth: good question, we can answer that once we get through Mani's questions no doubt

Guest 36 - G3
Is .3xmr/minute or .6xmr/2 minutes better?
Because the former was said when we had a 1m block time

bigreddmachine - B
Robert: let's assume Kovri is integrated, Mobile wallets are finished, etc... Can you ask: What are the biggest long-term challenges facing the Monero Project?

hyc - PC - HP
Guest 36, it amounts to the same either way

Bruce - B
I run a Monero node that I don't want to mine with. is that still confirming transactions with new supporting the network?

bigreddmachine - B
hyc, not quite. in a 0-latency network it wouldn't matter, but there's definitely a tradeoff using a 1 minute block time instead of something larger.

Bruce - B
'and' not 'with new'

bigreddmachine - B
Bruce, yes. You are relaying txs and validating

hyc - PC - HP
sure, but we have a 2 minute block time now, to reduce orphan chains

Bruce - B
thanks bigred

Guest 36 - G3
If the tail emission is too small, increasing it breaks the social contract?
I've always assumed the social contract has been 'some tail emission will exist'

Tyeth - T
the biggest issue i saw was with blockchains containing scripted transactions and other large scale thefts have led to forks.

Guest 36 - G3
and the .3/minute could be changed depending on security incentive empirically

palexander - P
The tail emission is sort of uncharted territory.  We don't exactly know how this will all pan out.

Guest 36 - G3
thats what I thought. Fluffy saying a tail emission change is a break of the social contract surprised me

palexander - P
As far as the emission curve goes, I doubt that will ever change.

bigreddmachine - B
.3 per minute is absolutely part of the social contract. That and being as privacy-oriented as possible. But 3 XMR 10-minute blocks or 0.15 XMR 30-second blocks both fit the .3 XMR per minute contract, and so that type of thing could change.

Tyeth - T
I'd imagine the tail gets reduced to infinitely small as ease increases/cost of production decreases

Guest 36 - G3
emission curve != tail
the tail is just a floor

palexander - P
Really, it doesn't matter.  The key is knowing the rate not really the maximum amount of units that will be available.

Guest 36 - G3
it turns linear at that point
the question is the slope of the line

hyc - PC - HP
slope is zero for the tail emission

Guest 36 - G3
slope of coin supply

bigreddmachine - B
slope of what? slope of total coins mined is 0.3 XMR per minute.

Smith - S
Is my IP address associated with creating transactions in the current state?

Guest 36 - G3
Only to the first node you broadcast to
and your ISP, if they're watching

Smith - S
Can someone link my IP to a specific transaction? Or just that I'm using Monero?

Guest 36 - G3
It would need to be a fairly targeted attack
and real-time
cant be done retroactively

palexander - P
Your ISP can link if you are under surveillance

hyc - PC - HP
well, not definitively, but yes, they can match timestamps in traffic logs

Justin (sgp) - J(
@Smith this is the concern that Kovri addresses. However, the IP information is only oberved to the nodes you connect with

Bruce - B
does the monero community have and general sense of direction regarding useage scaling. (ex. 1000 txs/s)

bigreddmachine - B
^^ Bruce that's what I was getting at with my Q before, Justin somewhat answered, but the basic conclusion is scaling on-chain 100% has a practical ceiling, likely much lower than Bitcoin due to larger TXs.

Bruce - B
gotcha

Smith - S
@Hyc But the transaction itself is obfuscated, so I'm still safe correct (the inputs, outputs and amts are obfuscated).

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
Bruce: we're not focused on on-chain scaling
there are some small things, which Justin mentioned, like reducing range-proof sizes
and maybe switching sig schemes later

hyc - PC - HP
@Smith yes

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
but focus is on layer 2 for scaling, trying to scale mainchain is a fool's errand

bigreddmachine - B
^^ unless you're Voldemort.

Guest 36 - G3
but muh big blocks

Bruce - B
are there layer 2 solutions that maintain similar obfuscation?

hyc - PC - HP
Hey, ASN.1/BER is excellent stuff

Robert Wolff - RW
https://github.com/monero-project

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
no, but we can have weaker layer 2 privacy and you can drop in and out of layer 1 during settlements to make up for the privacy loss

Bruce - B
👍

Robert Wolff - RW
https://github.com/monero-project/kovri

Riccardo &quot;fluffypony&quot; Spagni - RS
also MimbleWimble's privacy claims are "weak", but still significantly stronger than junk like Dash, and even stronger than ZCash's default t-address mode

palexander - P
"junk like Dash"?  Them's fightin' words

Bruce - B
that's the answer I was looking for. thanks.

Smith - S
Another question - why is Monero's market cap so low, considering the amount of actual progress that has been made?

hyc - PC - HP
RSA doesn't give us perfect forward secrecy...

Robert Wolff - RW
@David - miniNodes! Welcome!

palexander - P
Because a lot of people ride the hype train.
