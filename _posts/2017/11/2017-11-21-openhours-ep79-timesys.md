# Introduction

This week on OpenHours, we were joined by Maciej Halasz, Timesys Vice President of Technology. Who introduced us to the " Timesys University 4-part webinar series — Developing for Industrial IoT with Linux OS on DragonBoard™ 410c". A webinar series dedicated to exploring the process of building an embedded Linux based device using the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 410E powered DragonBoard 410c development board from Arrow Electronics.

As Maciej mentioned during the episode, the focus was on developing a security-rich Linux based platform and Qt based UI application for an IIoT(Industrial Internet of Things) platform. Apart from that, the webinar series also focuses on some other aspects such as topics that cover build systems, deployment strategy, designing-in and managing security, device appearance and ease of user interaction. And those who participate will be able to gain insight into various aspects of technology and design decisions developers face when choosing to build embedded Linux based products for this increasingly demanding and expanding connected world.

If you want to register the remaining sessions or watch recording of the past sessions, you can take a took at their website.
