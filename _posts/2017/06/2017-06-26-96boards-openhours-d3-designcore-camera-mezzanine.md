# Introduction

This special episode of 96Boards OpenHours was brought to you live from the Qualcomm Thinkabit lab in San Diego. We were joined by both Lawrence King and Rajan Mistry from Qualcomm, Jason Enslin and Scott Dunnington from D3 Engineering and over 130 community members from around the world! We couldn’t have hoped for a better turnout. During this episode we announced the new [DesignCore Camera Mezzanine for 96Boards](http://www.96boards.org/product/d3-designcore-camera-mezzanine/), talked about all of it’s resources and availability, then showcased the new mezzanine running on a [DragonBoard 410c](http://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/) with several cool demos(D3 Light box, and Lawrence’s ball tracking)! By the end of the broadcast, everyone got their questions answered and five lucky raffle winners took home a complete DragonBoard 410c / DesignCore Mezzanine kit, all of which were generously gifted by [Qualcomm](https://developer.qualcomm.com/) and [Arrow](https://www.arrow.com/).

If you missed it, this is your chance to get up to speed. The video, along with time stamps can be found below! I also recommend reading [this prequel blog on the D3 Mezzanine](http://www.96boards.org/blog/d3-designcore-camera-mezzanine-and-openhours/) prior to jumping into this OpenHours episode. Here we cover the complete out of box experience and software walk through.

I would like to extend a special thanks to Qualcomm and Arrow for donating the kits for this amazing raffle. A big thanks to the D3 Engineering team for joining us as featured guests. Thank you to Lawrence and Rajan for being there, onsite with me, and letting us use the Thinkabit lab at Qualcomm.

# Questions and Important Time Stamps

{% include media.html media_url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3nuVJmf9B0" %}

```
0:45 - Introduction to Location and On-site guests (Lawrence King and Rajan Mistry)
Lawrence is an engineer for Qualcomm who has worked on the DragonBoard 410c for some time now. Adding to the quality of its software and contributing to the community with demos and other fun projects. Rajan Mistry is the applications engineer for Qualcomm Developer Network and works on cool projects using the DragonBoard 410c and participates in Qualcomm related events.

2:10 - Episode breakdown

2:30 - A look at last week’s episode
Last week we spoke with Mani (Applications Engineer for 96Boards/Linaro) about his Home Surveillance project, all five parts. Etc… etc…

3:34 - Rules for participating in giveaway contest

4:43 - Sarah posted link for google form

6:18 - Introduction to D3 Engineering team

8:20 - Introduction to Camera Mezzanine from D3
D3 Camera Mezzanine is developed by D3 Engineering in partnering with Arrow and Qualcomm to allow Embedded vision applications on Dragonboard410c. It gives you the direct access to 2 port MIPI CSI interface and also breaks out other peripheral access pins (I2C, SPI, GPIO) etc.. It makes really a great platform for doing Embedded vision applications on Qualcomm platforms.

9:15 - Why 96Boards / Dragonboard 410c for this particular Camera board?
D3 wants to enable Embedded vision applications on lot of powerful SoC’s and 96Boards is a great way to do that with a standardized interface and with a one piece of hardware. In particular DragonBoard410c has lot of video capabilities in its SoC and really is a natural thing for us to port.

10:00 - Lawrence King give his insight on Camera Mezzanine initiative

11:35 - Camera Mezzanine demo from D3 Engineering
https://github.com/D3Engineering

You can see two repositories:

Linux_kernel_qcomlt - Linux kernel with all the modifications required for D3 Camera Mezzanin
410c_camera_support - Wiki, example applications and scripts for using this Mezzanine.

14:08 - Question: In order to get this Camera Mezzanine working with DragonBoard 410c you are using a custom built boot and root file system image, right?
D3: Yes. Right now it requires a custom boot and root file system images which you can download from github page. But eventually we like to get this into Linaro base release so that the board can work out of box.

14:42 - Nicholas Dechesne, Qualcomm Landing team lead from Linaro explains the future plans for this board support in Linaro release
We are actually working on getting this board support into our Linaro release. You can expect these boards will work out of the box in next or one after release,

15:28 - Continuation of demo from D3:
Shows the gstreamer example by executing a script on custom image setup and also points out the performance limitation as of now with UYUV Video Encoding format.  
Executes another example and shows improved video performance with YUV:420 format with 17-20 fps using custom OpenGL ES shader. Also shows some of the patterns built into the image sensor and toggling between switching ON/OFF autofocus.
All instructions are available on Wiki and source code is embedded into the image itself.

19:46 - Question: How many cameras are used for this demo?
This is a single camera demo and we have verified that these two cameras works with 4.4 release and we are yet to check with 4.9 release.

20:34 - Jason shows real world example using D3 Camera Mezzanine and DragonBoard 410c
Shows the two way dash cam mount which has the DragonBoard and Camera Mezzanine running 4.4 release. This was created for one of D3’s customer and demonstrated within two weeks.

22:29 - Question: Right now you are supporting OV5640. Do you plan to support more cameras in future?
Yes. D3 is working on bunch of different camera sensors ranging from 1MP to 25MP. Actually we would like to get the input from the community based on market needs and we can use the apt sensors on the board. There are lot of different directions it can go, we can add one more interface on the existing board or change the camera connector to accommodate different camera sensors.
Another interesting thing is, D3 is going lot of work with CMOS radar chips. We were thinking of creating a demo by putting one of the radar on secondary camera interface and showing the camera/radar fusion.

23:50 - Question: How are you accessing serial and other peripherals using this board?
I am using the Audio mezzanine board in between DragonBoard and Camera Mezzanine for accessing serial output and all. Actually D3 board is not changing the voltage levels, so it should be possible for it to use with any other Mezzanines.

25:04 - Question: What is kind of camera sensors D3 using for automotive solutions?
For automotive solutions , we work with sensors from Sony, Omnivision etc… We are doing lot of work with OV10640, Sony’s IMX 224, IMX 290 (1MP and 2MP) etc…

26:12 - Question: Has any company looked at D3 for agricultural use?
We work with lot of different vertical markets but not anything in agriculture as of now.

26:52 - Question: Do you have link to potential radar module?
Please go to D3 Engineering page (https://www.d3engineering.com/) Solutions->Autonomous Systems, we have some radar modules.

27:35 - Question: Any GPS tracking video from D3?
We haven’t done anything with GPS on this yet.
Lawrence: DragonBoard has onboard GPS.

28:12 - Question: Any plans on collaborating with FLIR?
Yes, We have done some stuffs with them. We worked with near IR and thermal space cameras. But it depends upon customer needs.

29:44 - Question: Any level shifters on this Camera Mezzanine also how about the pin alignment on it?
There is no level shifter and one I2C port is directly going to secondary camera, so only one I2C bus is accessible via expansion header on the Mezzanine.

30:48 - Question: Any test with 360 camera?
We worked with camera but not on this board. Also we are working on some stitching algorithm for 360 camera support.

32:11 - Question: Is there any model to work with low light/infrared surveillance?
Not sure about the model you are asking for. But you are given privilege to modify the hardware and software according to your needs.

33:14 - Question: For someone who is novice, what is the benefit of this platform over others? Online community, Sw/HW support etc..
Well you can use some of the features of MIPI cameras like autofocus and also it is really convenient to package it with dragonboard in a box like shown earlier.
We also provided github examples for using gstreamer and opengl etc… You can also use this kit along with dragonboard for path to production.

35:40 - Question: Is the 3d printed case source files available online?
I haven’t made it available yet but maybe I can do that. Also, we have posted board schematics in Arrow website.

37:20 - Demo from Lawrence king
I got patches from D3 for the camera mezzanine and 96Boards for hardware downscaler to reduce the size by 480x270. That image will be passed to OpenCV for tracking a ball.
Source code is available here

43:12 - Question: Can you provide me an update on leveraging new apps using various types of sensors?
I’m not sure about whether various sensors refers to different images sensors or other sensors. But what we have is a camera sensors on board and we have lot of other sensor support like Radar sensor, other sensor in pipeline.
Rest of the peripherals are also exposed on board which could be used for other tasks.

45:28 - Question: Any support to add 4 sensors on Mezzanine?
DragonBoard only has two CSI interfaces but you can use two dragonboard to connect 4 sensors and do multiplexing.

46:29 - Question: Are most people doing all images processing on board or they sending the pictures to cloud for manipulating?
The ball tracking demo you just saw ran entirely on Dragonboard nothing on cloud. It really depends on what kind of applications you are using. Dragonboard provides good processing power so you can do most of work on board itself.
I have even compiled the kernel entirely on Dragonboard itself.

49:50 - Question: Are there any API’s available to use this Camera Mezzanine?
Right now we are using v4l2 for capturing frames and Gstreamer/OpenGLES for displaying. Also, there is nothing custom in userspace, so any linux distro should work with our kernel modifications.

51:28 - Question: Any API’s available to use machine learning algorithm like Tensorflow from google?
Not really much we are doing for Machine learning as of now.

52:10 - Question: Is it possible to preprocess the camera image in ISP before it gets to CPU?
That is something we would like to enable, we are working with Qualcomm and 96Boards to enable that feature.

53:10 - Question: Can the Mezzanine supports custom lens and will there be any work for using them in pythography?
You can use any sensors which plugin into the sensor port on board.

54:52 - Question: Why did you choose shorter border 54mm to align the cameras instead of longer boarder 84mm?
Problem with 84mm is on one side you’ll have all the HDMI, USB cables  and on other side edge is blocked by 40 pin connector. So, probably is a good choice.

57:44 - Question: Why didn’t you leave the camera mezzanine close to Dragonboard’s RF antenna open?
Yeah, it may reduce the GPS sensitivity. Well take it as a feedback and probably incorporate in next revision.

1:00:00 - Raffle Winners announcement from Sarah
Thomas Hoppe, Tyeth Gundry, Keith Lee, Temilola Aberidigbe, Ali Gholamloo

1:02:53 - Question: Any chance to get the whole bundle (Dragonboard , D3 Camera mezzanine, power supply)?
It is not currently available on Arrow website, but there are plans to provide soon.

1:05:10 - Question: What is the url for embedded video consultants from this company?
D3 Engineering Embedded Vision Solutions: https://d3engineering.com/solutions/embedded-visionD3 Github Camera Mezzanine Board Wiki: https://github.com/d3engineering/410c_camera_support/wiki

1:05:53 - Question: Any plans to use hardware encoder/decoder on Dragonboard instead of OpenGL?
We like to enable that feature and that is in pipeline.

1:07:13 - Question: Is the tracking ball demo tried with higher resolution with HDMI off?
HDMI was on and it does run at higher resolution but the frame rate drops to 5fps for 1080p

1:07:50 - Question: What is the patch applied with the kernel for hardware?
Those patches are for using the hardware descaler.

1:08:45 - Question: How long does the kernel compilation take on Dragonboard?
Everything from setting swap space to booting the kernel took 2 hours.

1:09:30 - Question: Is the GPU used to run OpenCV for demo and is that API avaialble?
Yes and Yes. When you build OpenCV it will ask for GPU support.

1:11:00 - End of Show

Omar - O
hi Robert, question. Are there any library/APIs to use for this camera mezzanine?  And what's the scope of these?

Tyeth - T
@Guillermo: There was a cucumber picker that used a green spectral camera, and a normal camera.

Todd Thal - TT
Any api's to tie into standard machine learning algorithms or say "tensor flow" from google?

Tyeth - T
I thought another one used two different spectra specific cameras / filters.

marouane - M
can the mezzanine camera support custom lenses and will there be a development of one that could be used in photography

CEZAR - C
Hi, It's a very cool mezzanine. Nicely designed PCB, I noticed.Two Questions I have:[1] Why did you choose the shorter border of the Mezzanine (54mm) to align the cameras? Wouldn't it be better to use the longer border (85mm)?[2] Why didn't you leave the Mezzanine are close to the DragonBoard 410C RF antennas region clear of ground planes or metal parts? Didn't it compromise the RF performance of WiFi, Bluetooth or GPS of the DragonBoard 410C?

Todd Thal - TT
What's the URL for the embedded video consultants?
Any developer pages/github for this company ?

Sahaj Sarup - SS
any plans on working with the internal hardware video decoder/encoder of the 410c for better performance rather than opengl?

Sarah Levine - SL
5 winners have been picked, stay tuned until the end of the episode where I wil announce the winners

Todd Thal - TT
Can all the speakers give their contact information at the end?

will you provide the source code

alex - A
are you using wap memory on this dragonboard?
swap

Mani - M
alex: i don't think swap space is necessary here

Norma - N
Different sensors in general, but if you can share on the dif. camera sensors. Thanks!

Tyeth - T
@Lawrence: Wicked, did you try higher resolution outputs with the hdmi off? Also whats the crack with the hardware descaler, it sounds like something that was software before now (you mentioned patches)?

Sahaj Sarup - SS
for 4 cams it should be possible to multiplex between to, i have seen it for the raspi but could also be specific to hardware

steve b - SB
cool thx!

The tracking ball demo is great! I'm curious to review the source-code and learn some performance tricks.
Thanks!

inforce already has it

820 Dragonboard will not be available for sale until the software is approved by Qualcomm

for 4 cams it should be possible to multiplex between the two, i have seen it for the raspi but could also be specific to the hardware and interfaces

Bill - B
yup

CEZAR - C
Sure. I do need to purchase their book (pyimagesearch) ! Thanks!

Bill - B
you could also use an FPGA to do the muxing

Tyeth - T
Have you played with virtual channels @scott+Jason

I need some suggestions.. I have one IR LED glowing 10 -12 mtrs far and I want to track that using a cam.. any suggestions?

Ali - A
why did you choose python over c for ball tracking

Todd Thal - TT
What the URL for the blog with the videos for the ball demo

Guillermo - G
with an FPGA in the middle you could buffer frames to preserve the frame rate, if the bandwith of the link to the CPU allows it.

Deepak Mishra - DM
Ok thanks for the suggestions..

How does the D3 DesignCore camera mezzanine compare to the AIStarVision MIPI Adapter Mezzanine?  I'm not familar with either, just curious.

I'm leaving here a link a simple demo video of one of our projects. This demo uses 2 MIPI-CSI cameras (with AISTARVISION MIPI Adapter mezzanine) and explores some ideas of stereo vision and face recognition. I appreciate any feedback you may have!https://contest.embarcados.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DragonWally_demo_1_english_mini.mp4?_=2
