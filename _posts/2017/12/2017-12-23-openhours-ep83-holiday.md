# Introduction

**OpenHours Episode #83** - The holiday season is here and so is the time of giving (says many traditions :-)! For this, we once again welcome back [maddog](https://twitter.com/maddoghall) to share with us his holiday cheer and gift ideas during this wonderful time of the year. In this second annual holiday special, we will take open source gift giving to a whole new level as we look into some ideas that require a bit of work, some that require a bit of $$$, and other that are just plain fun or worthwhile to the open source enthusiast. So, dress in your finest holiday robes and join us in celebrating open source as a reason for the season!

Don’t forget to join us in our new [OpenHours IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/): **#OpenHours & #96boards**

Carl - C
brought a student to a Rails User Group and that lauched his career - so sharing FOSS and user group experienes is good.

Santa Penguin - SP
Yes!  There are many people who started their careers from a single event

afk... 2min

Tyeth - T
Universities should be able to contribute to the leading open source alternatives and then they'd also have the specialist technical knowledge to assist the other departments / students of the world.

Carl - C
Goood point Mani - also forcing students to buy heavy books instaed of cheap pdf's that won't force them to carry a 100 lbs of books would be great.

Mani - M
@Tyeth: Exactly

Carl - C
I would donate to that!!!

Guillermo - G
On the subject of MATLAB alternatives, check this out, you will be impressed:
https://www.scilab.org/

Sahaj - S
carry 100MB not 100lbs

Mani - M
@Carl: Agree with you

Guillermo - G
You can run .m scrpits almost unchanged.

Mani - M
@Gulliermo: yeah.scilab is also the best alternative to Matlab
@Sahaj is having something same on his list

Carl - C
she will remember that rest of her life
