# Happy New Year!


NOTE: Pair this blog with [this episode of OpenHours](https://youtu.be/kowVZBQaEN0)!

Yes that’s right, it is now the year 2017, and here at 96Boards headquarters (i.e. everywhere) things are anything but stagnant. In fact, for some time now the team has been hard at work devising a plan for this new and prosperous year. Still, while we do anticipate an action packed year for 96Boards (Spoiler alert: find out more later in the blog), it is always important to take a look back at all of the exciting things we have accomplished and seen in 2016...

# Still here!?


While I am sure there are plenty of other things I may have missed in 2016 around 96Boards, these were some of the highlights I was able to salvage and save. Yes, I am a digital hoarder! This means 2017 will be quite a busy year for me… Just wait, things are about to get crazy!

Now, since I have pretty much shared over one hundred links, I will give you all a minute to click around and enjoy the content…Back already? Great! I think it’s time to summarize a bit.

For 96Boards announcements and fun, be sure to visit and follow all of our social media channels! Seriously though, if you could only choose one, I would recommend Twitter :)

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/96Boards) &#124;[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/6637095?trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Ashowcase%2CclickedEntityId%3A6637095%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1483603913878%2Ctas%3A96boards) &#124;[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/96Boards/)

All are welcome to join LIVE, for free, to interact as equal members in the 96Boards tribe of enthusiasts and developers. This is YOUR channel and a means to bring up interesting and possibly controversial topics, explore new possibilities around the 96Boards brand, and pretty much anything else you would like to talk about! You can also join to hang out and have a quick chat while you enjoy your morning coffee or tea :D
