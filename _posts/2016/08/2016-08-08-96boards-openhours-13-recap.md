96Boards OpenHours continued this week with our between season format of holding a casual open hour to allow attendees to ask questions of Linaro's developers.  We started these open session Q&A with our session 10 and continued it this week with session 13.  This was an hour to have people hangout and ask whatever questions people may have about 96Boards.  To watch this weeks’ session go to (https://youtu.be/gqN2YdRUuPw)

{% include media.html media_url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqN2YdRUuPw?feature=oembed" %}

Last week in the hangout Robert shared a link to allow people to submit topics or questions for the developers on the hangout.  The link is:[ http://www.96boards.org/forums/topic/openhours-topic-suggestion/ ](http://www.96boards.org/forums/topic/openhours-topic-suggestion/)and Robert will take these suggestions and try to incorporate these into future OpenHours.  This week began with a question about Bluetooth and board support.  This was regarding Bluetooth Low Energy spec and this is a new generation of Bluetooth.  Robert mentioned bringing in one of the Linaro developers to help with this in more detail.  The team also worked with a community member that was having trouble with their board bring up.  The next topic was a battery question regarding the Dragon board and charging a battery off the board.  There was then a discussion about the software needed to do this, Robert offered to bring in the Linaro expert to help with this.  The community member will bring in the board to the call and get it hooked up with Linaro's help.  The next question was do you need an external signal for the GPS?  Akira explained that the weak signal is due to the certification and the Dragon board has a weak antenna as well.  There was a lot of discussion around this issue and possible solutions.  Mark then discussed some of the new devices he has seen and been using.  The discussion then turned to ideas of all kinds of different items that could be built.  The next question was about the pin outs on the HiKey Android boards, since there are many different boards no one knew that readily. At the end of the call Robert announce a Dragon Board give-away in the future in August.   There will be more information coming soon about the give-away.  As always there is a lot of good information and resources that was given in the chat below, this is a great place to get more detailed information.

Don't forget about the upcoming Linaro Connect where attendees have an opportunity to meet with Linaro in person and learn a lot more about what is going on in the community.  There are still openings available to attend this conference in Las Vegas, Nevada September 26-30, 2016 --[http://connect.linaro.org/](http://connect.linaro.org/).

Be sure to join us for the next OpenHours  [http://www.96boards.org/openhours/](http://www.96boards.org/openhours/).  Next week during session 13 we will have another open hour to just answer questions.  So join us and bring all your 96Board questions and we will try to answer them all for you.

Please remember, if you get stuck, there are resources to help you through the installation. Feel free to check out the [96Boards forums](http://www.96boards.org/forums/), [96Boards wiki](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki), or [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%2396boards) channel #96boards (there are many ways to access IRC, this website is one of them). Dig around the wiki, create a new forum thread, and/or post a question in the chat.

Tne new spec works a lot like Zigby

Dragonboard 410c supports piconet setup, which gives you master/client as well as 1-1 pairing




















sorry i cannt open video or micro

I don't know for sure, but I believe BLE would need hardware changes in the base design unless that was taken into account from the outset.

Great idea... an adapter pack for power plug.




















MW










there appears to be hardware support for charging via VBUS on the USB device connector








































MB












I bought a 50 pack of the power adapter plug on Ebay, can see part# in picture [http://www.ebay.com/itm/351596615215?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK:MEBIDX:IT](http://www.ebay.com/itm/351596615215?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK:MEBIDX:IT)

so quick look the pmic8916 is simulating battery supply via 3.7 BUCK output to PMIC VBAT+BAT_SNS

This is not the standard plug for Dragonboard hahaha

UCRobotics already have a design powering over battery
