Hello everyone! Welcome to the always fun (to read) and never boring blogs by the [96Boards](http://www.96boards.org/) team here at [Linaro](http://www.linaro.org/). I would like to keep this post short and sweet, since I will be forwarding you to a video and slideshow.

Not too long ago I was asked to create a workshop, to be presented on the Qualcomm campus (San Diego), for this year’s Qualcomm Interns. The workshop was intended to be a sort of “Board bring up” or “Out of the Box” experience guide for the DragonBoard 410c. The goal was to give everyone who attended the necessary information and resources needed to quickly and easily get setup with their DragonBoard 410c. Why you may ask? Well, these interns were about to embark on the ultimate journey, a hackathon loaded with prizes and bragging rights! While I do not know the exact specifics of the hackathon, I was still honored with the opportunity to help these DragonBoard 410c thrill seekers fulfill their quest by getting them started on their 96Boards.

Unaware they would be filming me, I openly accepted and suddenly grew more nervous… Nervous or not, the show must go on! Lucky for us, the video came out decent enough to share on the [96Boards YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjawhk_W1QnJs3pKIsKLJNg):

I hope you will all take some time to check out the video above. If you are a DragonBoard 410c user, I am sure you will find some much desired resources in the slideshow. If you don’t yet own a [DragonBoard 410c](http://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/) (or for that matter a 96Boards development board), be sure to visit the [96Boards website](http://www.96boards.org/) for more information on all the great product we have available!

I would like to give a big thanks to Qualcomm and everyone involved for inviting me to their San Diego campus to give this presentation, and thank you for allowing 96Boards to share this content with the community.

At 96Boards we take pride in our community involvement. Please remember, if you ever get stuck, there are plenty of resources. Feel free to check out the [96Boards forums](http://www.96boards.org/forums/), [96Boards documentation repository](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/), or [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%2396boards) channel #96Boards (there are many ways to access IRC, this website is one of them). Dig around the wiki, create a new forum thread, and/or post a question in the chat, myself or one of the 96Boards developers would love to help get your 96Boards up and running!

Don’t forget about the [Open Hours](http://www.96boards.org/openhours/) every Thursday, where we discuss pressing questions amongst a fun crowd of 96Boards users and developers over coffee. We hope to you see you there!
