96Boards OpenHours is a chance for those in the 96Boards community to come every Thursday to learn and ask questions about 96Boards.  This is our 16th episode and we are currently between seasons so this hour is available for those that call in to ask questions of the many developers we have on the call.   This week's episode included Robert making a few announcements about what is to come on the 96Boards OpenHours, including a DragonBoard give-away,  David Mandala gave a talk about some of the projects he has been working on and then we had several viewer questions that were answered.  To watch this weeks’ session go to ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8x1zGcl3O0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8x1zGcl3O0))

https://youtu.be/u8x1zGcl3O0

After the initial announcements Robert introduced David Mandala, who wrote a great blog on "[Gui & command line remote debugging](/blog/gui-command-line-remote-debugging/)".  David began by mentioning the Geppetto tool from Gumstix ([https://www.gumstix.com/geppetto/](https://www.gumstix.com/geppetto/)) and how it can help you with your build.  David then introduced his blog and talked about debugging with gdb, setting up your ARM 96Boards system, starting gdb-multiarch, and GUI source code debugging with ddd.  The hangout then opened up for attendee questions.  The first was why did Linaro pick the DragonBoard?  The short answer was because the DragonBoard and all of our 96Boards are built for your product to go to market.  Robert then discussed in more detail what this meant.   The next question was about what different types of applications are 96Boards being used for?  Robert talked about one segment, IoT, which has done some really great work with ideas for applications of 96Boards in the healthcare industry and in robotics.  There was also another walk thru of the new 96Boards documentation section of the website.   Robert also discussed the next three openhours that will be focused on the DragonBoard and an out-of-box experience.  It will also include a DragonBoard give-away as well, more details to come.

As always there is a lot of good information and resources that is in the chat below, this is a great place to get more detailed information.  Also a while ago in the hangout Robert shared a link to allow people to submit topics or questions for the developers on the hangout.  The link is:[ https://discuss.96boards.org/t/openhours-topic-suggestion/ ](https://discuss.96boards.org/t/openhours-topic-suggestion/)and Robert will take these suggestions and try to incorporate these into future OpenHours.

Don't forget about the upcoming Linaro Connect where attendees have an opportunity to meet with Linaro in person and learn a lot more about what is going on in the community.  There are still openings available to attend this conference in Las Vegas, Nevada September 26-30, 2016 --[http://connect.linaro.org/](http://connect.linaro.org/).

Be sure to join us for the next OpenHours  [https://www.96boards.org/openhours/](/openhours/).  Next week we will have another open hour to just answer questions.  So join us and bring all your 96Board questions and we will try to answer them all for you.

Please remember, if you get stuck, there are resources to help you through the installation. Feel free to check out the [96Boards forums](https://discuss.96boards.org/), [96Boards wiki](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki), or [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%2396boards) channel #96boards (there are many ways to access IRC, this website is one of them). Dig around the wiki, create a new forum thread, and/or post a question in the chat.

I haven't started in on the Hexagon DSP build from Intrinsyc. There are a couple of examples in the SDK. Is there any other documentation for working with the DSP?




















N












As 410c Development board was on backorder om [Arrow.com](http://arrow.com/),  I ordered 410 AWS IoT Starter kit from Arrow. Will that be useful for Coursera course, or I should order the 410c Dev board?




















VC












Another thing is 64-bit support




















G1












I asked the same question.  The AWS version is the exact same board with "preinstalled" Debian Linux with Amazon stuff.  It also comes with a power supply.  Where the other board doesn't have the power supply.






















Here so some inspirational ideas on how to use 96Boards or even DtagonBaordshttps://dragonboardcontest.com/contest/1/winners
