We are happy to announce the 16.03 release for the Reference Software
Platform project, right before Linaro Connect BKK16!

This is our third release, incorporating quite a few changes and
improvements for both the consumer and enterprise reference platforms.
We are also happy to share, for the first time, that we were able to
produce a common and unified kernel tree (4.4.0 based) that is shared
across all the supported platforms!

The unified kernel is a critical piece as we can concentrate the
development and validation into one single source tree, and also
allowing us to create one package (deb/rpm) that can be shared with
everyone. As a result of the integration of many different development
trees, we are also able to quickly spot issues that could later affect
upstream and distros (e.g. DT x ACPI).

Some of the highlights for this release (check

Since Linaro Connect BKK16 is just around the corner, please also make
sure to check the sessions involving 96Boards and the Reference
Software Project. Sessions we will cover next week:
* BKK16-100: Evolution of the Reference Software Platform Project
* BKK16-501: Kernel and bootloader consolidation and upstreaming
