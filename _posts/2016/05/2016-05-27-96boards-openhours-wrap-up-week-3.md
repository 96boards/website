Yesterday was the third installment of the 96Boards OpenHours sessions.  This week the topic was 96Boards compatible enhancements, design tools, and add-ons. This includes the available Mezzanine product line with sensors and 3D printed accessories.  To watch this weeks' session go to: [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7QR_KlXMRc&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7QR_KlXMRc&feature=youtu.be)

Below is an overview of what was discussed including the time in the video where this topic was discussed.

**The week started off  with a recap from last week:**

    1. Last week Robert talked about different 96Boards consumer boards – HiKey, Dragonboard 410C, Bubblegum-96
        1. Pointed out their unique aspects and went over a comparison table

    2. Also discussed were the operating systems available when purchased –
        1. Discussion about different operating systems that come with kits that complement them

  5. 96Boards for Mezzanine (seed sensor kit)


At 9:50 in the video there was a question: How do you know which Mezzanine board to pick?


  1. Discussion on different boards and uses for different projects


  2. Mezzanine boards bring your voltage up


At 18:01  a discussion began on different places to go online to get access accessories – including places where you can get your schematics printed on a 3-D printer and the suggestion of posting schematics onto the community site and get input to help improve your design

At 21:00 – Discussion about fritzing – see more in a blog by Ricardo Salveti - [https://www.96boards.org/blog/fritzing-part-96boards-ce/](/blog/fritzing-part-96boards-ce/)

At 21:40 – Introduction of Michael Welling and his  Robo Mezzanine board

Be sure to stay tune in next week where we will focus on a particularly important part of the 96Boards hardware (and software), the [low-speed expansion header]() and it’s many GPIO interfaces. Robert will highlight some great examples and steer you to a bank of resources that will help any hobbyist/developer get started with any 96Boards!  [https://www.96boards.org/openhours/](/openhours/)
