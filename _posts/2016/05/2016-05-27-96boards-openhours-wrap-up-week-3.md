Yesterday was the third installment of the 96Boards OpenHours sessions.  This week the topic was 96Boards compatible enhancements, design tools, and add-ons. This includes the available Mezzanine product line with sensors and 3D printed accessories.  To watch this weeks' session go to: [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7QR_KlXMRc&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7QR_KlXMRc&feature=youtu.be)

Below is an overview of what was discussed including the time in the video where this topic was discussed.

**The week started off  with a recap from last week:**

    1. Last week Robert talked about different 96Boards consumer boards – HiKey, Dragonboard 410C, Bubblegum-96
        1. Pointed out their unique aspects and went over a comparison table

    2. Also discussed were the operating systems available when purchased –
        1. Discussion about different operating systems that come with kits that complement them

  1. Discussion on different boards and uses for different projects


  2. Mezzanine boards bring your voltage up


At 18:01  a discussion began on different places to go online to get access accessories – including places where you can get your schematics printed on a 3-D printer and the suggestion of posting schematics onto the community site and get input to help improve your design

At 21:00 – Discussion about fritzing – see more in a blog by Ricardo Salveti - [http://www.96boards.org/blog/fritzing-part-96boards-ce/](http://www.96boards.org/blog/fritzing-part-96boards-ce/)

At 21:40 – Introduction of Michael Welling and his  Robo Mezzanine board

Be sure to stay tune in next week where we will focus on a particularly important part of the 96Boards hardware (and software), the [low-speed expansion header](http://www.96boards.org/documentation/ConsumerEdition/GPIO/LSExpansionHeader/README.md/) and it’s many GPIO interfaces. Robert will highlight some great examples and steer you to a bank of resources that will help any hobbyist/developer get started with any 96Boards!  [http://www.96boards.org/openhours/](http://www.96boards.org/openhours/)
