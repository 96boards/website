Welcome to our 30th episode of 96Boards OpenHours.  Last week we had a great discussion with David Mandala about creating a community mezzanine board.  David wrote a blog about this and it was posted on the 96Boards site:  [http://www.96boards.org/blog/community-mezzanine-board/](http://www.96boards.org/blog/community-mezzanine-board/).  Check out the blog for more information on this initiative.

Robert then spoke about the announcement that was made last week from Gumstix and Intel regarding the “GO Geppetto®” Intel® Joule™ Design Contest - for more information about this check out their site:  [https://www.gumstix.com/gogeppetto/?mc_cid=69078103ff&mc_eid=bcd2a7cf36](https://www.gumstix.com/gogeppetto/?mc_cid=69078103ff&mc_eid=bcd2a7cf36)

**3:20 -** Robert then kicked off this episode's topic by introducing the guest speaker, Andy Clark from Workshopshed.  Andy has a background in Aerospace and Electrical Engineering and has worked in software for more than 20 years.  He works on many of these projects in his free time from his regular job.  Andy then began working on the DragonBoard as part of a competition that he entered and he was sent a DragonBoard to use to work on his project proposal.   Since the contest he has been working with the DragonBoard for other projects.

**9:33** - Andy then began to talk about the DragonDetector and explaining how he got involved in the project.  He presented a slide deck that walked the audience through the project.

**16:06 -** Andy showed the DragonDetector he had built with the board

**24:40 -** Andy wrapped up his demo and Robert shared the git hub that will allow people to recreate his project:  [https://github.com/Workshopshed/Dragon](https://github.com/Workshopshed/Dragon)

**26:10 -** David Mandala talked about his initiative that he wrote the blog about.  He is looking at encouraging the community to create a mezzanine board.  [http://www.96boards.org/blog/community-mezzanine-board/](http://www.96boards.org/blog/community-mezzanine-board/)  He talked about this in more detail and the issues the community now faces with the current available boards.

**36:30-** Question:  Do we have any mezzanine on any i2s 1.8v module which someone has tested?

**41:15 -** Question:  Is it possible to use cellular network in 410c by any extension?

**45:55 -** Question:  Does anyone know where I can find a UK power cord for the DragonBoard?

Robert then wrapped up the call and invited everyone to join us next week.

The 3D model is available on the GitHub so you can print your own






















I went for a USB camera but if you wanted a high frame rate then a direct attached would be better

The MAX98357A I2C chip seems to accept a minimum of 1.2v for the digital signals. There's an AdaFruit board amplifier board you could try
