HiSilicon Technologies announced the arrival of Poplar, the first Linaro 96Boards TV Platform development board (Press release:[ http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-first-development-board-compliant-96boards-tv-platform-specification/](http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-first-development-board-compliant-96boards-tv-platform-specification/) ).

The Poplar board is manufactured by Tocoding Technologies and is described here:[http://en.tocoding.com/index.php/96boards-poplar/](http://en.tocoding.com/index.php/96boards-poplar/)

The board supports the HiSilicon quad-core 3798C V200 and is targeted at professional set-top box and TV panel developers, as well as the open source maker community (see image of board below). The Poplar board ships with Android 5.1.1 installed.
