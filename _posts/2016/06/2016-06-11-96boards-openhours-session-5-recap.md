Our fifth 96Boards OpenHours session the team discussed in more detail enabling the GPIO libraries on 96Boards.  To watch this weeks’ session go to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbTo3BwURg8&feature=em-subs_digest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbTo3BwURg8&feature=em-subs_digest)

Below is an overview of what was discussed including the time in the video where this topic was discussed.

**The week started off with a recap from last week:**

Last week the team discussed General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) and low speed expansion header, these interfaces help us manipulate and interpret data from the environment using our 96Boards.  To watch last weeks’ session go to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzOy_WV_HwU&index=4&list=PL-NF6S9MM_W1QBjUc2B5Pg502bz7qslxk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzOy_WV_HwU&index=4&list=PL-NF6S9MM_W1QBjUc2B5Pg502bz7qslxk)

    * You can view a follow-up blog that Akira wrote on this topic here: [https://www.96boards.org/blog/programing-i2c-devices-libmraa-libupm/](https://www.96boards.org/blog/programing-i2c-devices-libmraa-libupm/)





  * 7:28 – question on how to access the libraries from the terminals


  * 9:42 – Akira begins his talk that includes some great demos


    * Akira began by giving some background on how he started doing the work he is now





  * 17:10 – Akira began talk on using the different 96Boards available boards how they are each different and how to solve the problem


  * 19:30 – Discussion on the different libraries


  * 45 – Akira gives a demo of his work on I2C and GPIO


  * 33:57 – Robert talks about available kits that are mentioned in many of the previous blogs and what comes in the available kits and what you can buy separately as well


  * 36:40 – Questions and Answer session


Be sure to stay tune in next week where we will discuss installing Docker on aarch64 with the reference platform build on a 96Boards CE-edition [https://www.96boards.org/openhours/](https://www.96boards.org/openhours/)

Please remember, if you get stuck, there are resources to help you through the installation. Feel free to check out the [96Boards forums](https://discuss.96boards.org/), [96Boards wiki](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki), or [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%2396boards) channel #96boards (there are many ways to access IRC, this website is one of them).
