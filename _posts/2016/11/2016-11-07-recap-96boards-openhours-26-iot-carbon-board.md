Welcome to episode 26 in our OpenHours series.  In this episode Robert had guest speaker Ricardo Salveti talk about IoT using the 96Boards Carbon board.   Ricardo Salveti took questions about this new board, and discussed his demo that he showed at Linaro Connect LAS16.

Robert began by discussing last week's episode that showed a Gumstix drone.  There is  great blog that discussed specifically how you can build your own drone and gives step by step instructions and more information.  [http://www.96boards.org/blog/diy-drone-featuring-gumstix-96boards-take-flight-openhours/ ](http://www.96boards.org/blog/diy-drone-featuring-gumstix-96boards-take-flight-openhours/).  Robert then gave several other links that may be of interest for those looking to build this drone to see where you can get the parts shows:  [https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/96Boards-c-30.html](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/96Boards-c-30.html)  and also to follow Gumstix [https://twitter.com/gstixguru](https://twitter.com/gstixguru).  To watch last week's episode you can view it here:   Youtube: [http://linaro.co/96byt](http://linaro.co/96byt)











Today's episode began with the introduction of Ricardo who has been working in the Linux space for over 10 years now and his work in IoT.  Ricardo gave some information about his background in working with Linaro and in the industry.  He then discussed the new Carbon Board that was announced during the Linaro Connect LAS16 and showed the difference in sizes of some of the current boards including the new Carbon that is very small.  He discussed the specifications for it and what they are trying to do.  Here is a link to more information on IoT Specification: [http://www.96boards.org/specifications/](http://www.96boards.org/specifications/).







9:43 - Question - is there any input on the agriculture industry in the specifications?
















13:44 - Ricardo began to discuss the specifics about the Carbon board.  You can read more about the product features and information here:  [http://www.96boards.org/product/carbon/ ](http://www.96boards.org/product/carbon/).  Ricardo showed the board and talked about each of the components and what you can use them for.
















18:26 -Question - What is the strategy in place to prevent a Cracker from updating it with different firmware? That is how the Ukraine power grid got taken down.  Ricardo discussed the security on the board and how complex security can be.







20:59 - Question - What was the method of over-the-air updates? Ricardo talked about updates and best practices and the different options.  He then talked about what was demonstrated at Connect.







24:28 - Question - For the digital outputs will there be PWM support for servos etc?










25:11 - Question - What is the development environment for developing with Carbon?  Ricardo discussed the OS (Zephyr) and the code and environment to flash the device.  There is also a getting started that page that helps users get started with some prebuilt images - [https://nexus.zephyrproject.org/content/sites/site/org.zephyrproject.zephyr/dev/index.html](https://nexus.zephyrproject.org/content/sites/site/org.zephyrproject.zephyr/dev/index.html) and [https://www.zephyrproject.org/](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)










 29:10 - Question - Is there a toolchain for compiling a code along with the os?  Ricardo explains that there are actually two toolchains that you can  use.







29:50 - Question - What's the situation with upstreaming Carbon support to Zephyr?  Ricardo talked about future plans with upstreaming Carbon.







34:20 - Ricardo began showing his demo of Carbon.

**Be sure to join us for next week's OpenHours:  [https://www.96boards.org/openhours/](https://www.96boards.org/openhours/)**

As always there is a lot of good information and resources that is available in the chat below, this is a great place to get more detailed information mentioned during the call.  Also a while ago in the hangout Robert shared a link to allow people to submit topics or questions for the developers on the hangout.  The link is:[ http://www.96boards.org/forums/topic/openhours-topic-suggestion/ ](http://www.96boards.org/forums/topic/openhours-topic-suggestion/)and Robert will take these suggestions and try to incorporate these into future OpenHours.

Please remember, if you get stuck, there are resources to help you through the installation. Feel free to check out the [96Boards forums](http://www.96boards.org/forums/), [96Boards wiki](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki), or [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%2396boards) channel #96boards (there are many ways to access IRC, this website is one of them). Dig around the wiki, create a new forum thread, and/or post a question in the chat.

What's the situation with upstreaming Carbon support to Zephyr? I was surprised to see Nitrogen to have been upstreamed first (while Carbon got first into people's hands).
