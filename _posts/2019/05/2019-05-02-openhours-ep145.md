# Introduction

This week the 96Boards team took a few rounds of Q&As, we updated on what we've been up to and threw in a few demos! Unfortunately, Robert was out sick. Still, the show must go on. 96Boards engineers (Sahaj and Mani) had plenty to talk about and showcase during this week's episode of OpenHours.
