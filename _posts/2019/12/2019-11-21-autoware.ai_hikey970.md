# Introduction
This is the first entry of our "96boards: Autoware everywhere" blog series. With this blog series we will show how to use 96boards hardware to run different components of the Autoware software stack for autonomous vehicles.

### Autoware.AI
[Autoware.AI](https://www.autoware.ai/) is the world's first "All-in-One" open-source software for autonomous driving technology. It is based on ROS 1 and available under Apache 2.0 license. It contains the following modules:
- Localization is achieved by 3D maps and SLAM algorithms in combination with GNSS and IMU sensors.
- Detection uses cameras and LiDARs with sensor fusion algorithms and deep neural networks.
- Prediction and Planning are based on probabilistic robotics and rule-based systems, partly using deep neural networks as well.
- The output of Autoware to the vehicle is a twist of velocity and angular velocity. This is a part of Control, though the major part of Control stack commonly reside in the by-wire controller of the vehicle.

### Autoware.Auto
[Autoware.Auto](https://www.autoware.auto/) is a project supported by the [Autoware Foundation](https://www.autoware.org/). It is a clean slate rewrite of Autoware. Autoware.Auto applies best-in-class software engineering practices which include pull request reviews, pull request builds, comprehensive documentation, 100% code coverage, a coding style guide, and a defined development and release process, all managed by an open source community manager.

It also has crisply defined interfaces for different modules including messages and APIs and a software architecture designed for determinism such that will be possible to reproduce behaviors live and on development machines.


To kick things off we will first start outlining how to get [Autoware.AI's rosbag demo](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo) running on the headless Hikey970 and use a different machine for visualization.

The post is organized as follows:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Getting Autoware.AI](#getting-autoware.ai)
- [ROS2 and the pendulum demo](#ros2-and-the-pendulum-demo)
  - [Rttest library modifications](#rttest-library-modifications)

## Requirements
For the following steps you will need your Hikey970 to be accesible via SSH and for an easier setup have Docker installed on it. So, to get the board ready you can follow the steps [here](https://www.96boards.org/blog/hikey970-rt/) if you plan to also develop real time applications using ROS/ROS2 or just use the [Bionic Builder Tool](https://discuss.96boards.org/t/tool-bionic-builder-automated-kernel-ubuntu-builder-for-hikey970/7879) to get Ubuntu 18.04 working.

In addition, to install Docker you just need to follow the official steps to install docker on arm64 target for [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). Though it is also possible to [install ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) natively on the board running Ubuntu 18.04.

## Getting Autoware.AI

### From source
If you have opted for installing ROS natively on the board you can follow the [Autoware.AI source build instructions](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/Source-Build) to get it installed natively.

### Docker

# Conclusion

Upon completion of the steps above we now have a working board with a real time enabled kernel.

Next time, we'll reproduce the ROS2 and pendulum demo test that was conducted on the Hikey970 in our [previous post](https://www.96boards.org/blog/hikey970-ros2/), so keep an eye to this space.
