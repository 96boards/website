# Introduction

In this blog we are expanding the range of 96boards we can use for real time software development. Following on the [Hikey970](https://www.96boards.org/blog/hikey970-rt/) we will focus on the [Qualcomm® Robotics Dragonboard-845c Development Platform](https://www.96boards.org/product/rb3-platform/).

The Robotics DragonBoard™ 845c development board features the Qualcomm SDA845 processor which is a heterogeneous computing architecture and integrates an Octa Core Qualcomm® Kryo™ CPU with performance up to 2.8GHz a Qualcomm® Adreno™ 630 Visual Processing Subsystem (including GPU, VPU and DPU), and a Qualcomm® Hexagon™ 685 DSP with Hexagon Vector Extensions (HVX) delivering sophisticated, on-device AI processing and mobile-optimized computer vision (CV) capabilities for perception, navigation and manipulation

The post is organized as follows:
- [Initial Setup](#initial-setup)
- [Kernel upgrade and flash](#kernel-upgrade-and-flash)

***

## Initial Setup
Prior to getting the real time enabled kernel on the board we need to follow the steps in the [Dragonboard-845c documentation](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/dragonboard/dragonboard845c/installation/linux-fastboot.md.html) to get Debian Buster running on the board.

After completing the steps we are now able to `ssh` onto our board using the default `linaro` user and password. This allows us to `scp` the compiled kernel modules later on.


## Kernel upgrade and flash
Now, to get the real time enabled kernel compiled and flashed on the boards we just need to follow the next steps:

- Checkout 5.2 Kernel from Linaro's Qualcomm landing team:
```
$ git clone https://git.linaro.org/landing-teams/working/qualcomm/kernel.git -b release/db845c/qcomlt-5.2 linux-qcomlt-5.2
$ cd linux-qcomlt-5.2
$ git checkout b13017c21d43cf5cbe81129c650ed5ed44d8adb0
$ cd ..
```
- Download the appropriate preempt_rt patch and apply it to the kernel source:
```
$ wget https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.2/older/patch-5.2-rt1.patch.xz
$ cd linux-qcomlt-5.2
$ xzcat ../patch-5.2-rt1.patch.xz | patch -p1
```
- Build the default kernel config and enable the fully preemptible option for the kernel build in _General Setup -> Preemption Model -> Fully Preemptible Kernel (RT)_:
```
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- defconfig
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig
```
- Build the kernel and modules:
```
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- dtbs modules Image.gz
```
- Now let's install the modules into a local directory:
```
$ mkdir db845_modules
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=./db845_modules
$ tar czf db845_modules.tar.gz db845_modules
```
- `scp` the compressed modules over to the board and extract them into `/lib/modules` so they are available after we install the real time enabled kernel.

- Change directory to one level above `linux-qcomlt-5.2` and get the ramdisk and a convenience build script:
```
$ cd ..
$ wget http://snapshots.linaro.org/96boards/dragonboard845c/linaro/debian/latest/initrd.img-5.2.0-qcomlt-arm64
$ wget http://people.linaro.org/~servando.german.serrano/db845/build_db845.sh
$ chmod +x build_db845.sh
```
- And, finally, put the Dragonboard-845c in fastboot mode and use the build script to flash the real time enabled kernel:
```
$ ./build_db845.sh
```
- After flashing the kernel reboot the board and log into it, e.g. via the serial port. Now, if everything went well doing `uname -v` should show ``... SMP PREEMPT RT ...`` so we can confirm that the running kernel has been successfully patched.

***

# Conclusion

Upon completion of the steps above we now have a working board with a real time enabled kernel.

Next time, we'll reproduce the ROS2 and pendulum demo test that was conducted on the Hikey970 in our [previous post](https://www.96boards.org/blog/hikey970-ros2/), so keep an eye to this space.
