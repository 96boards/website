# Introduction

This is the fourth entry of our **96Boards: Real time and ROS2** series. On the previous ones we have enabled a RT kernel on the [Hikey970](https://www.96boards.org/blog/hikey970-rt/) and on the [Dragonboard-845c](https://www.96boards.org/blog/db845-rt/) and tried the [ROS2 pendulum on the Hikey970](https://www.96boards.org/blog/hikey970-ros2/).

In this blog post we will also run the pendulum demo on the RT-enabled Dragonboard-845c while also evaluating FastRTPS and Eclipse Cyclone DDS implementations.

The post is organized as follows:
- [Installing Docker](#installing-docker)
- [ROS2](#ros2)
- [Pendulum demo](#pendulum-demo)

***

## Installing Docker

Linaro's Debian image is based on Debian Buster. At the time of writing Debian Buster is **not** a [Supported platform for ROS2 Dashing Diademata.](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Releases/Release-Dashing-Diademata/#id3) So, in order to run the [ROS2 pendulum demo](https://index.ros.org//doc/ros2/Tutorials/Real-Time-Programming/) we need to install Docker in the board.

To install Docker Community Edition on the Dragonboard-845c please follow the next steps:

- Run:
```
$ sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
```
- Then follow the official steps to install docker on arm64 target for [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/).

We can now pull a ROS2 based Docker image to use in our board.

## ROS2

[Here](2019-11-15-hikey970-ros2.md/#ros2)


- Now pull and run a docker image containing ROS. The following is based on `melodic perception` with a root `linaro` user enabled by default:
```
sudo docker pull 96boards/ros:dashing
sudo docker run -it --rm --user linaro 96boards/ros:dashing
```

It is now possible to use ROS packages within the running container.


## Pendulum demo

docker run -it --rm --privileged --net=host -u linaro 96boards/ros:ros1_bridge /bin/bash -c "source /opt/ros/dashing/local_setup.bash && ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge --bridge-all-topics"


***

# Conclusion

Upon completion of the steps above we now have a working board with a real time enabled kernel.

Next time, we'll reproduce the ROS2 and pendulum demo test that was conducted on the Hikey970 in our [previous post](https://www.96boards.org/blog/hikey970-ros2/), so keep an eye to this space.
