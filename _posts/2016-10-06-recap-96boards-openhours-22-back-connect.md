This was our first episode after the week of Linaro Connect.   It was a small hangout and a little shorter than normal.  Robert began the hangout with a recap of what took place at Linaro Connect.  He discussed the OpenHours that took place live during the week - see below to view all the recorded sessions and the presentations given that pertained to 96Boards.

In this OpenHours the first question was regarding what Linaro does and how 96Boards is related to Linaro.  Robert gave an in-depth overview of how these are all connected.  The next question was about Microsoft and it's opensource involvement and the Windows 10 upgrade.  The group then discussed a project that one of the attendees was working on and gave feedback.  There was a lot of discussion on what each of the attendees was working on.  Robert then announced that OpenHours season 2 will officially kick-off on October 20th.

    * 96Boards aims to end outdated documentation by implementing a dynamic approach which utilizes member and community resources, paired with on point maintenance and diligent review from the 96Boards team and Linaro. Doing this, we can provide up-to-date, straightforward, and accurate documentation without the need to share documents, convert formats, or refer to releases/versions when wondering if the document is going to work.
