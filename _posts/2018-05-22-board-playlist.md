# Play lists on YouTube

Hello all,
Just a short announcement, the 96Boards team has started to curate a video Play-lists on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/96boards) dedicated to some of our newer boards that are around the corner.

Two of the play lists that are already uploaded are for:
- **[The Ultra96](https://www.youtube.com/embed/?listType=playlist&list=PL-NF6S9MM_W0V7iIE5UTj12IvvpAfUdhj):** Ultra96™ is a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+™ MPSoC based Arm development board that uses FPGA for accelerated Machine Learning Applications
- **[The Developer Box](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-NF6S9MM_W0gNpGSrE6qo1WcKoNGNqFG):** is an Enterprise Edition board based on the Socionext SC2A11 which is a 24-core Low-Power Arm Soc for Server Applications.

All of these play lists will be "Work In Progress" forever, meaning that we will be continuously adding new content to them. Of course we are not limiting ourselves to just these boards, and plan to add play-lists containing guides, walk-through and more for more of our boards soon.
