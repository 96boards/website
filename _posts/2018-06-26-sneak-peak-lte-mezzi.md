# Sneak Peak
Just a very quick look at the 4G LTE mezzanine that will be arriving this August.

Without giving out much of the specs, I was able to get the 4G connectivity working by simple inserting the SIM card and selecting the LTE/Mobile Broadband option from the "Network Menu" and entering the APN.
> Tested on DragonBoard410c with Debian 18.01

You do require an external antenna which will be provided in the box, although it works very slow if you do not have the antenna attached.

Apart from the 4G LTE Connectivity, the mezzanine also has a rather large array of sensors on-board.

If you would like to learn more about this, Shiratech will be announcing this mezzanine on OpenHours on the 5th of July 2018

And now for some video demo of the LTE connectivity:
