# Introduction

Panel of industry professionals including Gumstix, Qualcomm, Arm, 96Boards, QWERTY Embedded and Red Hat!

Sponsored by Linaro - We welcomed everyone (on site and online) to participate in the ultimate community driven experience. This special LIVE broadcast will take place over the BlueJeans video conferencing tool, in front of a live audience at the first Linaro Connect of 2017. 

We started this episode with some fun 96Boards OpenHours facts, interesting bits about the history of OpenHours. After the initial ice breakers, we move into panel introductions and then started taking questions. Onsite participants had plenty of questions as well as some from those who joined us on BlueJeans. An hour of questions later and it was time for a short demo from uCRobotics on the Bubblegum96 board. Don't miss this exciting episode, video and some resources are available below.

A special thanks to Red Hat, 96Boards and BlueJeans for providing some special swag to all of our onsite guests (shirts, hats and fidget spinners), as well as all of those who joined us from universities around San Francisco.
