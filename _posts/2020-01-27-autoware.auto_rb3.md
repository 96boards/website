# Introduction
Following our previous entries of the "96boards: Autoware everywhere" blog series where we focused on the Hikey970 we now move on to a different board, the [QualcommÂ® Robotics (RB3) Dragonboard-845c Development Platform.](https://www.96boards.org/product/rb3-platform/)

As we did for the Hikey970 we will show how to run different subcomponents of Autoware on the RB3 platform. The post is organized as follows:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Getting the Docker images](#getting-the-docker-images)
- [Getting the demo data](#getting-the-demo-data)
- [Running the demos](#running-the-demos)
  - [.AI Rosbag demo](#ai-rosbag-demo)
  - [.Auto 3D Perception demo](#auto-3d-perception-demo)
  - [.AI and .Auto bridge](#ai-and-auto-bridge)

***
## Requirements
The steps outlined in this blog posts build up on our previous posts and as such you need to:
- Have your RB3 board running with Debian Buster as outlined [here](https://www.96boards.org/product/rb3-platform/) and with [Docker installed.](https://www.96boards.org/blog/db845-ros2/#installing-docker)
- Be familiar with the work that we conducted previously within the "Autoware everywhere" series on [Autoware.AI](https://www.96boards.org/blog/autoware.ai_hikey970/), [Autoware.Auto](https://www.96boards.org/blog/autoware.auto_hikey970/) and [how to bridge both.](https://www.96boards.org/blog/autoware_bridge_hikey970/)

In addition, if you plan on developing real-time applications in the future your board should be running a RT-enabled kernel as we outlined [here](https://www.96boards.org/blog/db845-rt/).

## Getting the Docker images
We need to get the following Docker images:
```
$ docker pull autoware/arm64v8:1.13.0-melodic
$ docker pull 96boards/ros:ros1_bridge
$ docker pull 96boards/autoware:auto_20200121
```

## Getting the demo data
In addition to the Docker images we need to get the demo data for [Autoware.AI's rosbag demo](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo) and the [Autoware.Auto 3D Perception Stack demo](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/perception-stack.html). To do so:
- Create a `shared_dir` folder that will be mounted as a volume inside the docker container:
```
$ mkdir ~/shared_dir
```
we will use this folder to store the demo data.
- Download the demo data:
```
$ cd ~/shared_dir
$ wget http://db3.ertl.jp/autoware/sample_data/sample_moriyama_data.tar.gz
$ wget http://db3.ertl.jp/autoware/sample_data/sample_moriyama_150324.tar.gz
$ tar xzf sample_moriyama_data.tar.gz
$ rm sample_moriyama_data.tar.gz
$ tar xzf sample_moriyama_150324.tar.gz
$ rm sample_moriyama_150324.tar.gz
$ wget http://people.linaro.org/~servando.german.serrano/autoware/autoware.auto_get_demo_data
$ chmod +x autoware.auto_get_demo_data
$ ./autoware.auto_get_demo_data
$ wget http://people.linaro.org/~servando.german.serrano/autoware/headless_setup.yaml
```

## Running the demos

We are now set to start with the different demos. Let's find out how far we can push the RB3 board.

### .AI Rosbag demo

**NOTE:** Due to memory constraints on the Hikey970 we will not be able to run all the rosbag demo components in the board. So we will run `my_map.launch`, `my_sensing.launch` and `my_localization.launch` in the Hikey970 and will use a separate laptop for visualization and to run `my_detection.launch`, `my_mission_planning.launch` and `my_motion_planning.launch`. This means you will also need to get Autoware.AI's docker repo in the laptop as explained [above](#docker).

If you have chosen to just install Ubuntu 18.04 using the Bionic Buil Tool and use a monitor with the board you can follow the default [rosbag demo steps](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo) since you have access to the GUI. For the headless approach please keep reading.

To be able to run the demo we need to download the [demo data](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo#demo-data) and extract it inside the `shared_dir` folder. We will then have the following:
```
$ ls shared_dir
data  sample_moriyama_150324.bag
```
To run headless we will also need to setup some Autoware parameters. We can `wget` the setup file into the `shared_dir`:
```
$ cd ~/shared_dir
$ wget http://people.linaro.org/~servando.german.serrano/autoware/headless_setup.yaml
```

To run the each component of the demo independently we will need **4** terminals where we have ssh'ed into the Hikey970 and **4** more terminals in the separate laptop.

### In Hikey970
In Terminal 1 we run our container and, within it, make an `.autoware` folder and copy the `data` folder over:
```
$ ./run.sh -c off -i autoware/arm64v8 -t 1.13.0
$ mkdir ~/.autoware
$ cp -r ~/shared_dir/data ~/.autoware/data
```
We also need to set some environment variables following the [ROS in Multiple Machines tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines) to be able to run the visualization in a laptop. To avoid repeating the same setup steps in each of the terminals we can do:
```
$ echo "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://BOARD_IP_ADDRESS:11311" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
inside the container in Terminal 1, where `BOARD_IP_ADDRESS` is the current IP address of your Hikey970.

In one of the other terminals we check the name of the created container, which will be something like:
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
3dc4cbcd8519        autoware/arm64v8:1.13.0-melodic   "/tmp/entrypoint.sh"   39 seconds ago      Up 39 seconds                           goofy_lamarr
```
We can now access the same container on each of the terminals so that we do not need set the same environment variables on each individual container. On terminals 2 to 4 we do:
```
$ docker exec -it -u autoware goofy_lamarr /bin/bash
$ cd ~
$ source Autoware/install/setup.bash
```
1. Hikey970 -> Terminal 1
```
$ roscore &
$ rosparam load ~/shared_dir/headless_setup.yaml &
$ rosbag play --pause ~/shared_dir/sample_moriyama_150324.bag
```
2. Hikey970 -> Terminal 2
```
$ roslaunch autoware_quickstart_examples my_map.launch
```
3. Hikey970 -> Terminal 3
```
$ roslaunch autoware_quickstart_examples my_sensing.launch
```
4. Hikey970 -> Terminal 4
```
$ roslaunch autoware_quickstart_examples my_localization.launch
```

### In laptop

We launch the Autoware.AI's container in terminal 1
```
$ cd ~/docker/generic
$ ./run.sh -c off -t 1.13.0
$ echo "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://BOARD_IP_ADDRESS:11311" >> ~/.bashrc
```

After the container is launched, we need to check its name with `docker ps` and `docker exec` on it followed by sourcing the `Autoware/install/setup.bash` file as we did with the Hikey970 for terminals 2 to 4.

Afterwards:
1. Laptop -> Terminal 1
```
$ rosrun rviz rviz
```
and load the default config as per step 5 in [here](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo#steps).
2. Laptop -> Terminal 2
```
$ roslaunch autoware_quickstart_examples my_detection.launch
```
3. Laptop -> Terminal 3
```
$ roslaunch autoware_quickstart_examples my_mission_planning.launch
```
4. Laptop -> Terminal 4
```
$ roslaunch autoware_quickstart_examples my_motion_planning.launch
```

Now, it is certainly possible that if you have established the laptop-Hikey970 connection via Wifi attempting to use the default `config` file as per step 5 in [the rosbag demo steps](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo#steps) will show errors and the full demo visualization will not be achieved.

To check that the localization is running appropriately in the board instead of running `rviz` in the laptop we can do:
```
$ roslaunch lidar_localizer ndt_matching_monitor.launch &
$ rostopic echo /ndt_monitor/ndt_status
```
Once the ndt matching algorithm is able to localize based on the lidar readings and the pointcloud map you will see `data: "NDT_OK"` in the terminal.

### .Auto 3D Perception demo

To run the Autoware.Auto 3D Perception Stack demo we will roughly follow the steps [here](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/perception-stack.html) but adapted to our setup.

In the laptop we get the config files and open 2 terminals to run 2 instances of `rviz2` as:
```
$ wget https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/raw/master/src/tools/autoware_auto_examples/rviz2/autoware.rviz
$ wget https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/raw/master/src/tools/autoware_auto_examples/rviz2/autoware_voxel.rviz
```
- _Terminal 1_:
```
$ rviz2 -d autoware.rviz
```
- _Terminal 2_:
```
$ rviz2 -d autoware_voxel.rviz
```

Now we need to `ssh` into the Hikey970 in **4** terminals and then we need to do the following:

2. In _Terminal 1_:
```
$ docker run -it --rm --privileged --net=host -u linaro -v ~/shared_dir:/home/linaro/shared_dir:rw 96boards/autoware:auto /bin/bash
$ cd ~
$ source AutowareAuto/install/setup.bash
```

3. In terminals 2 to 4 we need to access the running container as we did [here](https://www.96boards.org/blog/autoware.ai_hikey970/#in-hikey970) but using the `linaro` user:
```
$ docker exec -it -u linaro CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash
$ cd ~
$ source AutowareAuto/install/setup.bash
```

4. _Terminal 1_:
```
$ udpreplay ~/shared_dir/route_small_loop_rw-127.0.0.1.pcap
```

5. _Terminal 2_:
```
$ ros2 run velodyne_node velodyne_cloud_node_exe __params:=/home/"${USER}"/AutowareAuto/src/drivers/velodyne_node/param/vlp16_test.param.yaml
```

6. _Terminal 3_:
```
$ ros2 run ray_ground_classifier_nodes ray_ground_classifier_cloud_node_exe __params:=/home/"${USER}"/AutowareAuto/src/perception/filters/ray_ground_classifier_nodes/param/vlp16_lexus.param.yaml
```

7. _Terminal 4_:
```
$ ros2 run voxel_grid_nodes voxel_grid_cloud_node_exe __params:=/home/"${USER}"/AutowareAuto/src/perception/filters/voxel_grid_nodes/param/vlp16_lexus_centroid.param.yaml
```

If everything went fine we will be able to visualize the demo point cloud and downsampled one in the running `rviz2` GUIs as can be seen in the image below.


### .AI and .Auto bridge

# Conclusion

In this blog post we have explored how to run the sensing and localization components of Autoware.AI on the Hikey970. This shows that it is possible to use affordable hardware for development purposes of certain components of Autoware and sets the basis for how to run it headless as opposed to using the GUI. In addition we can also try with another board for the other components that we currently run in the laptop, which is something we will show in other blog post in the near future.

Next time, we will give a go at Autoware.Auto on the Hikey970 and we will follow the [Autoware.Auto 3D Perception Stack demo](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/perception-stack.html), so keep an eye to this space.
