# Flick3D

## 3D touch over i2c

[Flick3D](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/flick-large-standalone-3d-tracking-gesture-breakout) is a fairly popular Raspberry Pi HAT. But it also has another variant called the Flick Large which breaks out i2c so that its usable with other development boards.

Flick3D is based on the [MGC3030/3130](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40001667E.pdf), a 3D gesture recognition and motion tracking controller chips based on Microchip’s patented GestIC® technology.

## Making it work with MRAA

The [Flick git repo](https://github.com/PiSupply/Flick) already provides us with a cpp based implementation, but its based on Arduino or wiringpi, both of which are not compatible with 96Boards as they are very specific to the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Boards. 96Boards uses more generic solution, mraa(https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa).

So I went ahead and ported the library to use mraa, this should work with RaspberryPi as well as its compatible with mraa. Take a look at the source at the [Projects Org Repo](https://github.com/96boards-projects/flick3d)
