# Happy New Year - WW96D!

As 2017 comes to a close, I could not help but write a blog to summarize the many things 96Boards has done throughout the year! Of course, with every new year, we welcome new experiences, exciting challenges, and open our minds to the endless possibilities that await us... So, let's look back at last year but focus on 2018 and ask:

**What Will 96Boards Do?**

NOTE: Pair this blog with [this episode of OpenHours](https://youtu.be/N9GoyGRZh8g)!

For all you audio/visual folks, get caught up by visiting the [96Boards YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/96boards?sub_confirmation=1). There you will find several playlists to help maneuver through the content. **Don’t forget to subscribe**!

96Boards teamed up with Qualcomm, UCSD, Jacobs School of Engineering, IEEE and HKN (IEEE Honors society at UCSD) to help host a hackathon around the DragonBoard 410c. The hackathon would last one full day and welcome over 100 students to participate! By the end of the event, more than 20 amazing projects were featured and prizes were given to the winners. A look back at the projects and some event highlights can be found on the 96Boards YouTube Channel under the [HARD Hackathon playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-NF6S9MM_W1xI5NiKVjR2mQ5AvBxMqww).

96Boards had the opportunity to participate in two events during the month of February. We teamed up with Qualcomm and Tecnologico de Monterrey University in Chihuahua to host a hackathon around the DragonBoard 410c. The hackathon focused on "Smart Cities" and had over 150 student participants. By the end of this hackathon, [we saw many great new projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-NF6S9MM_W2ss20r7NZiyZBiz85zHuw5) and opened opportunities for future events in Mexico. 96Boards continues to work with professors from Tec de Monterrey and hope to bring 96Boards even further into academia with this new network. During the same dates, 96Boards and Linaro also had a booth for the [Embedded Linux Conference in Oregon](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pSlkQDW7RpnNLuxPq6WVUR)! The conference which lasted several days featured many open source activities, sessions, workshops, and of course swag from the booth crawl. We look forward to hopefully being a part of ELC NA in 2018 as well.

If you are aching to follow more than just 96Boards, travel on over to my Twitter and give it a follow as well! [www.twitter.com/sdrobertw](http://www.twitter.com/sdrobertw)

For those of you who prefer a mailing list, we have just the one for you! You can choose between our “[Monthly Newsletter](/digest/)” and our “[Weekly Digest](/digest/)”. Get ready for just the right amount of commitment and information, 2018 is calling and 96Boards is here to answer.

Remember, you are all the reason this is possible. Please join us in welcoming a vibrant and new twist on community engagement. With OpenHours, we will take on some exciting challenges this year.

Every week at 4:00pm UTC the 96Boards team engages in the ultimate community driven experience. All are welcome to join LIVE, for free, to interact as equal members in the 96Boards tribe of enthusiasts and developers. This is YOUR channel and a means to bring up interesting and possibly controversial topics, explore new possibilities around the 96Boards brand, and pretty much anything else you would like to talk about! You can also join to hang out and have a quick chat while you enjoy your morning coffee or tea :D
