# Happy New Year - WW96D!

As 2017 comes to a close, I could not help but write a blog to summarize the many things 96Boards has done throughout the year! Of course, with every new year, we welcome new experiences, exciting challenges, and open our minds to the endless possibilities that await us... So, let's look back at last year but focus on 2018 and ask:

**What Will 96Boards Do?**

NOTE: Pair this blog with [this episode of OpenHours](https://youtu.be/N9GoyGRZh8g)!

For all you audio/visual folks, get caught up by visiting the [96Boards YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/96boards?sub_confirmation=1). There you will find several playlists to help maneuver through the content. **Don’t forget to subscribe**!

96Boards teamed up with Qualcomm, UCSD, Jacobs School of Engineering, IEEE and HKN (IEEE Honors society at UCSD) to help host a hackathon around the DragonBoard 410c. The hackathon would last one full day and welcome over 100 students to participate! By the end of the event, more than 20 amazing projects were featured and prizes were given to the winners.

## February, 2017

### Noteworthy

96Boards had the opportunity to participate in two events during the month of February. We teamed up with Qualcomm and Tecnologico de Monterrey University in Chihuahua to host a hackathon around the DragonBoard 410c. The hackathon focused on "Smart Cities" and had over 150 student participants. By the end of this hackathon, [we saw many great new projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-NF6S9MM_W2ss20r7NZiyZBiz85zHuw5) and opened opportunities for future events in Mexico. 96Boards continues to work with professors from Tec de Monterrey and hope to bring 96Boards even further into academia with this new network. During the same dates, 96Boards and Linaro also had a booth for the [Embedded Linux Conference in Oregon](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pSlkQDW7RpnNLuxPq6WVUR)! The conference which lasted several days featured many open source activities, sessions, workshops, and of course swag from the booth crawl. We look forward to hopefully being a part of ELC NA in 2018 as well.
