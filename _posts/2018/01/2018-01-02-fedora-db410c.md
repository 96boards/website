# Hey, Nice Fedora you got there!
## What is Fedora?

Apart from being a hat with a soft brim and indented crown, the kind of fedora we like to talk about is a Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel and GNU programs (a Linux distribution). It IS related to Hat(s) but not in a fashion sort of way. It's developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by the Red Hat company.

Apart from that, Fedora is my recommended Linux distro for a while now thanks to its update cycle, which is not too bleeding edge like Arch, and also not too Long-Term like Ubuntu or Debian and all of that without compromising on stability.


## Fedora and ARM
Fedora has been pushing on ARM and ARM SBC support for a while now, and with the release of Fedora 27, they are pushing forward for arm64/aarch64 or arm-v8 support.

## Fedora and 96Boards
And in their efforts, Peter Robinson -  Principal IoT Architect for Red Hat - has written detailed instruction on his blog to get the latest release of Fedora 27 for ARM64 working on the 96boards Dragonboard 410c.

And with that, I am extremely excited to see my favorite Linux distro working on the 96Boards platform. A big shout out to Peter Robinson for his efforts and. Here's to many more 96Boards being supported on Fedora.
