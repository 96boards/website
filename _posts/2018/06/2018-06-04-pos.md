# POS

"The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment. It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is usually printed but is increasingly being dispensed with or sent electronically." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale)


# The Project

This project is aimed to demonstrate the viability of 96Boards CE Boards in the field of POS Systems.

It contains 4 nodes, all of which can be served by a 96Boards CE Board:
- Database Server running MariaDB or MySQL
- Admin/Manager Node
- Kitchen Node
- Waiter/Table Node

**The Source Code and Guide for this project can be found at the 96boards Projects Org: [POS](https://github.com/96boards-projects/pos)**

# The Application

### Database Installer

To make the initialization of the database easier, I added a small GUI for initialized the required tables and default "admin" account.

### Admin/Manager Login

This account activates only when logged in as admin and allows for addition, deletion and modification of menu items as well as looking at a full order history.

### Kitchen Login

This login allows you to view pending orders and dismiss them once completed.

### Customer Login

This allows customers to maintain their profile, view their order history, create new order and manage their account.
