# Introduction

This week, we met with Ramon Horkany and Guy Zohar from [Shiratech Solutions](http://www.shiratech-solutions.com/). Shiratech is a new 96Boards partner who has hit the ground running with two amazing 96Boards mezzanine boards, which will soon be available to the public! Want to know more about these products? Well, read on and check out the video! Throughout the hour long broadcast, we spoke about Shiratech’s new tech, asked and answered questions from the community and showcased one of the new [LTE Mezzanine](https://www.96boards.org/product/shiratech-lte/) with a fun demo! Brought to you by [Sahaj, the Barbarian / Conquerer](https://www.youtube.com/user/sahajsarup) our famous 96Boards engineer and YouTuber (Thx Todd :-P). Don’t miss this one!

Tyeth Gundry - TG
What other Main boards have you tried it successfully with?

Rajan - R
Also, Quectel’s 4G/LTE CAT-1 EC21 and the CAT-4 EC25 modules, based on the MDM9x07 LTE modems from Qualcomm.

Tyeth Gundry - TG
lol

Rajan - R
what are you using to show the raw data?what is this dashboard built in?

Tyeth Gundry - TG
There's a double speed 4G in the UK on the EE network, I believe this uses dual channel version in two different bands. Would such a thing be possible?
(4G = LTE)

Ragnar - R
what type of coax connectors?

Tyeth Gundry - TG
Turns out it's called 4GEE according to marketing ;)"Average speeds on EE’s 4G network are 12-15Mb/second. The UK average for 3G is 1.5Mb/second.

We're rolling out a new enhancement to our 4G network, so average speeds will be twice as fast as today – 24-30Mb/second. And top speeds are up to 60Mb/second.

Upload speeds will also be doubled to 11Mb/second. We can do this because we have sufficient portions of 1800 spectrum to upgrade our customers to 2x20 MHz from the current 2x10 MHz they use today."
Thanks
Yeah no probs
Dont
The bottom paragraph is useful, I'm checking chip spec now, 60mps

Angie - A
When you connect another mezzanine with additinal sensors do you have to customize the dashboard for the data?
additional

Sahaj - S
can't find the connector specs 

Tyeth Gundry - TG
Once you guys share the project ;) we can customise it as needed

Angie - A
Thank you!

Tyeth Gundry - TG
Omg, so cunning, incredibly useful

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(

Tyeth Gundry - TG
Push this to universities. The mathematical engineering crew are playing with microcontrollers these days but only basic arduino /pi stuff
@Robert: You look at level shifting and i2c / other BUS logic, and you become slightly dirtier inside but happier overall

Robert Wolff (Desk) - R(
lol
Yes, @Tyeth

Tyeth Gundry - TG
on that note thank god for Firmata
lol
"Of course you can"
Now the Bosch sensor board is really intriguing, can we see/hear more?
Please partner with http://www.sensirion.com/ They have a lovely sensor called the SGPC10

BMP388 pressure sensor relative accuracy: ±0.08 hPa that compares to about 63 mm (2.5") of air if I did the maths right.  Could allow cool projects...

Tyeth Gundry - TG
@Guy+Ramon: You should also look at the 96Boards SOMs that are spec'd but not officially released
Hire Michael Welling from QWERTY (previous episode) he has the connections and ability
Submit to git?
