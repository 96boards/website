# Line-In/AUX Input to a Dragonboard

For my next project, I really wanted to do something based on audio, something like a visualizer. But... How to you take audio input on boards that have just audio output that too via HDMI.

After thinking for a bit an idea sparked, the Dragonbord(s) have mic input, so why not plug the Aux into that? Well, as it turns out the voltage levels of line-out and mic are fairly different, about +/- 2v for line in and +/- 1.6v for the mic input.

But How?

Not an electronics guy... so i went to the forums...

>
- Step 1: Have a problem?
- Step 2: Ask on the 96Boards forum...
- Step 3: Get questions answered...
- Step 4: ???
- Step 5: Profit!

In all seriousness though, Lawrence ended up answering my question and that too as detailed as possible. **[I really recommend you check out his reply.](https://discuss.96boards.org/t/stereo-mic-audio-input/4729/2)**

And i ended up with this schematic to bring the Line-In levels down...

- R1: 22K Ohms
- R2 R3: 2.7K Ohms
- C1: 22uF

> **Note: 1.8v Mic Bias pin on the audio header is not enabled by default, but you can use the 1.bv pin on the Low-Speed header**

... and it looks something like this:

And finally I am able to record Line-In audio on a dragon-board using audacity!

I have just tested this on a DragonBoard410c, but since the 820c also has an audio header it should work as well...
