# Introduction

**This week**, we will spoke with **[Meral](https://www.instagram.com/my.startuplife/)** and **[Isaac](https://www.instagram.com/iiiccc/)** from [Hello Chava](https://www.hellochava.com/), two of the hardest working people I follow on Instagram. On an almost daily basis, you will find Meral logging and broadcasting the good, bad and ugly faces of a startup life. Her followers get to see it all and take part in this amazing journey through engaging stories and posts. Over time, it has become somewhat of a habit to check up on Hello Chava (among other ventures) to see how things are going! All of this, through Meral's digital looking glass on Instagram. Holding true to the name "my.startuplife", Meral offers a first hand look at what it's like to be a hard working entrepenuer in this fast moving and competative tech world.

Talking about Hello Chava, what were the problems that kept you awake?

Rajan - R
what type of resources do you need to scale?
might be different for different architectures, but did you guys think about scaling from day one? or did you have to change something major to be able to scale your app?
so what you are saying is "It is ok to burn the first version to the ground"
