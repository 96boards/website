We invite Linaro developers and Linaro Connect attendees to join us for a fun and challenging Hackathon based on 96Boards made by [Arrow Electronics](www.arrow.com) and [Shiratech-solutions](www.shiratech-solutions.com).
 
The accepted Hackathon participants will each receive a kit consisting of an Arrow Dragonboard and three Shiratech 96Boards Mezzanines so they can start developing at home before the event and continue in their spare time during the event.
