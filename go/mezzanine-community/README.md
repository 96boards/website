# By the Community, For the Community

The 96Boards Mezzanine Community was formed by a group of individuals who shared the passion of Open-Source hardware & software.

This community aims to create an ecosystem of Open-Hardware platforms based around the 96Boards CE Mezzanine Specification and also provide a unified platform to host mezzanine designs.

The community repository is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community](https://github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community)

The community also meets Bi-Weekly, Mondays at 4PM UTC over [BlueJeans Video Conference](https://github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community#meetings-and-notes).

And you can also find the community members hanging out on IRC on the #OpenHours Channel (on freenode.net) which they have politely hijacked.
