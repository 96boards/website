## Resources

**Getting started:**

*   Linux installation – select the Micro SD card with Linux from your hack kit and follow the instructions in the [DragonBoard 410c Linux User Guide](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/dragonboard410c/guides/) to install from a microSD card, skipping the initial download steps because we’ve done that work for you.
*   Android installation – Android is preloaded on the DragonBoard 410c. If you remove Android and wish to re-install it, visit the Qualcomm table to get a Micro SD card with Android. Then follow the instructions in the [DragonBoard 410c Android User Guide](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/consumer/dragonboard/dragonboard410c/guides/AndroidUserGuide_DragonBoard.pdf) to install from a microSD card, skipping the initial download steps because we’ve done that work for you.
