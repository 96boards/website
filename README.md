# 96Boards.org

The 96Boards website is built using the Jekyll static site generator. It is based off of the jumbo-jekyll-theme used for all of the Linaro static sites. With the move from Wordpress to Static we have introduced GitHub/Community driven content that allows 96Boards.org users to submit issues about any of the pages on 96Boards.org through the associated Git respository.

## Issues 
If you come across any bugs/issues then please let us know by clicking the Submit an Issue button located at the bottom of every 96Boards.org web page. 

## Contributions
We happy to consider any contributions/feature requests that you may submit so please submit a PR with your changes and we will take a look.
