# 96Boards.org

The 96Boards website is built using the Jekyll static site generator. It is based off of the jumbo-jekyll-theme used for all of the Linaro static sites. With the move from Wordpress to Static we have introduced GitHub/Community driven content that allows 96Boards.org users to submit issues about any of the pages on 96Boards.org through the associated Git respository. This GitHub repository is combined with the 96Boards Documentation repo to build the site. Documentation is copied to the `_documentation` collection upon site builds with [bamboo.linaro.org](https://bamboo.linaro.org).

# 96Boards.org Specific Guides

## Adding products

### Step 1 - Duplicate similiar product folder

In order to add a product copy one of the products currently in the [_product folder](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/_product). Products are organsied in the _product folder into the 96Boards specifcations that are avaialble ([ce](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/_product/ce), [ee](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/_product/ee), [ie](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/_product/ie), and [mezzaanine](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/_product/mezzanine)). Please duplicate a product folder from one of these specification sub folders and modify accordingly. 

### Step 2 - Modify the front matter

We use the Jekyll front matter (YAML) values to help render your product on our Jekyll site. Please look at the other products README.md's for reference on how to structure the front matter (YAML).

Below we will step through each front matter(yaml) setting and explain what each value is used for when building the static pages.

```yaml
---
# Your Product title - this is the definitive product title.
title: Sophon Edge
# The layout to be used - below is the layout that you should use unless
# you have been directed otherwise by one of the 96Boards team.
layout: product-display-page
# This is the url that your product will be available at. 
# You should stick to the format /product/product-title
# Please use dashes between words to keep the format consistent.
permalink: /product/sophon-edge/
# The description of your product is used for the web pages description meta tag
# and on page content where a description of your product is need. To maximise the
# effectiveness of your description please choose a powerful starting sentence.
description: |-

```

### Step 3 - Add product images

Please add product images to the images/ sub folder inside the folder for your board. Make sure to `optimize` these images as best as possible to reduce the overhead on users when loading your product page. The first image that you add to the front matter will be the one that is used on the homepage/product index pages. Therefore you should ensure that this image is optimized whilst also being a relatively high resolution so that your product is displayed correctly.

Below you can see example of the product_images front matter value that you need to change to match your product images that you add to the images subfolder.

```yaml
---
...
product_images:
    - sophon-front-sd.png
    - sophon-back-sd.png
...
---

```

__Please note:__ Due to the way product images are include, images **should not include spaces** in the filename otherwise they may not be rendered on the website as expected.

## Adding 96Boards News

### External News
To add external news to 96boards.org that will show under [/news/](https://www.96boards.org/news/) simply add an entry to the [news.yml](https://github.com/96boards/website/blob/master/_data/news.yaml) file. Below is an example entry:

```
# Add a link to the external news article.
- link: https://www.cnx-software.com/2018/04/16/hikey-970-development-board-now-up-for-pre-order-for-299-99/
  # Add the title of your news post.
  title: CNX Software
  # Tag news with a board's permalink for it to show on that boards page.
  board: /product/hikey970/
  # Make sure to add the correct date.
  date: 2019-03-05 09:00:00+00:00
  tags: hikey970, ce
```

If you add a `board` with a valid product permalink url then your news will display on the product page as featured news (only the top 10 results will show - newest first).


### Internal News

If you'd like to add internal 96Boards news then add a News/Blog to 96Boards.org and tag with `96Boards`. The top 10 most recent posts on Linaro.org that feature 96Boards will then display on /news/.
