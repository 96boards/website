The Autoware Foundation is a non-profit organisation created by TierIV, 96Boards and Apex.AI to initiate, grow, and fund
open source collaborative engineering Autoware projects, starting with Autoware.AI, Autoware. The Autoware Foundation’s
mission is to democratize autonomous driving technology in an open way. Supported by various 96Boards platforms, we
would like to help students and researchers get a headstart.

This hackathon is an opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience with Autoware to develop a better
understanding of its capabilities for research projects. The hackathon will start with an introduction to Autoware,
followed by three days of hacking. Experts will be there throughout to support all levels of experience and by the end
of the hackathon we hope to have a distributed Autoware running on a number of 96Boards.
