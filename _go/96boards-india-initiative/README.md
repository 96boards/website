# 96Boards India Initiative

This page provides the resources for 96Boards India initiative which aims at
designing and manufacturing 96Boards in India.

## Boards to target

1. [96Boards IoT Edition](https://www.96boards.org/products/ie/)
2. [96Boards Consumer Edition](https://www.96boards.org/products/ce/)
3. [96Boards Enterprise Edition](https://www.96boards.org/products/ee/)

## Target 1 - 96Boards IoT Edition

IoT edition boards aims at producing development boards in microcontroller form
factor for Internet of Things.

### Operating System to use

* [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)

### Microcontrollers to use

Following is the list of microcontroller families to use in 96Boards IE.
List is sorted based on the SoC support in Zephyr.

* STM32Fx
* nRF5x
* NXP FRDM
* TI CC3220
* TI MSP432F4xx
