The 96Boards Mezzanine Community was formed by a group of individuals who shared the passion of Open-Source hardware & software.

This community aims to create an ecosystem of Open-Hardware platforms based around the 96Boards CE Mezzanine Specification and also provide a unified platform to host mezzanine designs.

### Want to check out the repository?
The community repository is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community](https://github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community)

The community also meets Bi-Weekly, Mondays at 5PM UTC over [BlueJeans Video Conference](https://github.com/96boards/mezzanine-community#meetings-and-notes).
