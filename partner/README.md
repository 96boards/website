## 96Boards Partner Program

The 96Boards Partner Program is designed for board vendors, mezzanine & module vendors, electronics design houses, software and service suppliers, product developers and other organizations. The program is designed to engage organizations and communities and encourage collaboration among them, creating opportunities, accelerating innovation, and promoting design and development in a broad arena which would be challenging for individuals or organizations to achieve individually.

The 96Boards Partner Program’s mission is to bring the community together in the ecosystem so that developers, product designers, manufacturers, distributors, and service providers can work together on non-differentiating engineering – thus sharing efficiently developed solutions and focusing more of their own resources on their individual competitive strengths.

Please get in touch by filling the form if you are interested to become a 96Boards Partner.
